wikipedia-23885690," Research Design and Standards Organization  The Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) is an ISO 9001 research and development organisation under the Ministry of Railways of India, which functions as a technical adviser and consultant to the Railway Board, the Zonal Railways, the Railway Production Units, RITES and IRCON International in respect of design and standardisation of railway equipment and problems related to railway construction, operation and maintenance. History. To enforce standardisation and co-ordination between various railway systems in British India, the Indian Railway Conference Association (IRCA) was set up in 1903. It was followed by the establishment of the Central Standards Office (CSO) in 1930, for preparation of designs, standards and specifications. However, till independence in 1947, most of the designs and manufacture of railway equipments was entrusted to foreign consultants. After independence, a new organisation called Railway Testing and Research Centre (RTRC) was set up in 1952 at Lucknow, for undertaking intensive investigation of railway problems, providing basic criteria and new concepts for design purposes, for testing prototypes and generally assisting in finding solutions for specific problems. In 1957, the Central Standards Office (CSO) and the Railway Testing and Research Centre (RTRC) were integrated into a single unit named Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) under the Ministry of Railways with its headquarters at Manaknagar, Lucknow. The status of RDSO was changed from an ""Attached Office"" to a ""Zonal Railway"" on April 1, 2003, to give it greater flexibility and a boost to the research and development activities. Organisation. The RDSO is headed by a Director General who ranks with a General Manager of a Zonal Railway. The Director General is assisted by an Additional Director General and 23 Sr. Executive Directors and Executive Directors, who are in charge of the 27 directorates: Bridges and Structures, the Centre for Advanced Maintenance Techlogy (AMTECH), Carriage, Geotechnical Engineering, Testing, Track Design, Medical, EMU & Power Supply, Engine Development, Finance & Accounts, Telecommunication, Quality Assurance, Personnel, Works, Psycho-Technical, Research, Signal, Wagon Design, Electric Locomotive, Stores, Track Machines & Monitoring, Traction Installation, Energy Management, Traffic, Metallurgical & Chemical, Motive Power and Library & Publications.

wikipedia-23885928," The Death of Bunny Munro  The Death of Bunny Munro is the second novel written by Nick Cave, best known as the lead singer of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. His first novel, ""And the Ass Saw the Angel"", was published in 1989. The novel deals with Bunny Munro, a middle aged lothario whose constant womanising and alcohol abuse comes to a head after the suicide of his wife. A travelling door to door beauty product salesman, he and his son go on an increasingly out of control road trip around Brighton, over which looms the shadow of a serial killer making his way towards Brighton, as well as Bunny's own mortality. The novel is set in Brighton in 2003, around the time the West Pier was destroyed by fire. Many of the locations and street names used in the book relate to real places close to Cave's own home. The novel was also released as an audiobook, using a 3D audio effect produced and sound directed by British artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, with a soundtrack by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis and in a number of Ebook formats including an Enhanced Editions iPhone application that synchronises the audiobook with the text, and includes exclusive videos of Nick reading. A series of live events took place in late 2009 to promote the book under the title of ""A Night with Nick Cave"", combining music, readings and a Q&A session with the audience. Reception. Irvine Welsh, Neil Labute and David Peace have all touted the novel - providing back-cover reviews. Moreover, ""The Death of Bunny Munro"" has received strong reviews from the British media: Graeme Thomson (writing in The Observer, 6 September 2009) awarded the novel four stars. Likewise, the Saturday Times (on the 5th of September 2009) stated, in a very positive review, that the novel ""reads like a good indie movie"".  The novel was nominated for the Literary Review's Bad Sex in Fiction Award, but did not win. "
wikipedia-23886057," Management of prostate cancer  Treatment for prostate cancer may involve active surveillance, surgery, radiation therapy including brachytherapy (prostate brachytherapy) and external beam radiation therapy, High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), chemotherapy, cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, or some combination. Which option is best depends on the stage of the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other important factors are the man's age, his general health, and his feelings about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because all treatments can have significant side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations. The selection of treatment options may be a complex decision involving many factors. For example, radical prostatectomy after primary radiation failure is a very technically challenging surgery and may not be an option. This may enter into the treatment decision. If the cancer has spread beyond the prostate, treatment options significantly change, so most doctors that treat prostate cancer use a variety of nomograms to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, HIFU, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. However, there are exceptions: Radiation therapy may be used for some advanced tumors, and hormonal therapy is used for some early stage tumors. Cryotherapy (the process of freezing the tumor), hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses. Active surveillance. Active surveillance refers to observation and regular monitoring without invasive treatment. In the context of prostate disease this usually comprises regular PSA blood tests and prostate biopsies. Active surveillance is often used when an early stage, slow-growing prostate cancer is suspected. However, watchful waiting may also be suggested when the risks of surgery, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy outweigh the possible benefits. Other treatments can be started if symptoms develop, or if there are signs that the cancer growth is accelerating (e.g., rapidly rising PSA, increase in Gleason score on repeat biopsy, etc.). Approximately one-third of men that choose active surveillance for early stage tumors eventually have signs of tumor progression, and they may need to begin treatment within three years. Men that choose active surveillance avoid the risks of surgery, radiation, and other treatments. The risk of disease progression and metastasis (spread of the cancer) may be increased, but this increase risk appears to be small if the program of surveillance is followed closely, generally including serial PSA assessments and repeat prostate biopsies every 1–2 years depending on the PSA trends. Study results in 2011 suggest active surveillance is the best choice for older 'low-risk' patients. For younger men, a trial of active surveillance may not mean avoiding treatment altogether, but may reasonably allow a delay of a few years or more, during which time the quality of life impact of active treatment can be avoided. Published data to date suggest that carefully selected men will not miss a window for cure with this approach. Additional health problems that develop with advancing age during the observation period can also make it harder to undergo surgery and radiation therapy. Hormonal therapy. Hormonal therapy uses medications or surgery to block prostate cancer cells from getting dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone produced in the prostate and required for the growth and spread of most prostate cancer cells. Blocking DHT often causes prostate cancer to stop growing and even shrink. However, hormonal therapy rarely cures prostate cancer because cancers that initially respond to hormonal therapy typically become resistant after one to two years. Hormonal therapy is, therefore, usually used when cancer has spread from the prostate. It may also be given to certain men undergoing radiation therapy or surgery to help prevent return of their cancer. Hormonal therapy for prostate cancer targets the pathways the body uses to produce DHT. A feedback loop involving the testicles, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary, adrenal, and prostate glands controls the blood levels of DHT. First, low blood levels of DHT stimulate the hypothalamus to produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH then stimulates the pituitary gland to produce luteinizing hormone (LH), and LH stimulates the testicles to produce testosterone. Finally, testosterone from the testicles and dehydroepiandrosterone from the adrenal glands stimulate the prostate to produce more DHT. Hormonal therapy can decrease levels of DHT by interrupting this pathway at any point. There are several forms of hormonal therapy: The most successful hormonal treatments are orchiectomy and GnRH agonists. Despite their higher cost, GnRH agonists are often chosen over orchiectomy for cosmetic and emotional reasons. Eventually, total androgen blockade may prove to be better than orchiectomy or GnRH agonists used alone. Each treatment has disadvantages that limit its use in certain circumstances. Although orchiectomy is a low-risk surgery, the psychological impact of removing the testicles can be significant, and sterility is certain. The loss of testosterone can cause hot flashes, weight gain, loss of libido, enlargement of the breasts (gynecomastia), impotence, penile atrophy, and osteoporosis. GnRH agonists eventually cause the same side effects as orchiectomy but may cause worse symptoms at the beginning of treatment. When GnRH agonists are first used, testosterone surges can lead to increased bone pain from metastatic cancer, so antiandrogens or abarelix is often added to blunt these side effects. Estrogens are not commonly used because they increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and blood clots. In general, the antiandrogens do not cause impotence, and usually cause less loss of bone and muscle mass. Ketoconazole can cause liver damage with prolonged use, and aminoglutethimide can cause skin rashes. Surgery. Surgical removal of the prostate, or prostatectomy, is a common treatment either for early stage prostate cancer or for cancer that has failed to respond to radiation therapy. The most common type is radical retropubic prostatectomy, when the surgeon removes the prostate through an abdominal incision. Another type is radical perineal prostatectomy, when the surgeon removes the prostate through an incision in the perineum, the skin between the scrotum and anus. Radical prostatectomy can also be performed laparoscopically, through a series of small (1 cm) incisions in the abdomen, with or without the assistance of a surgical robot. Radical prostatectomy. Radical prostatectomy is effective for tumors that have not spread beyond the prostate; cure rates depend on risk factors such as PSA level and Gleason grade. However, it may cause nerve damage that may significantly alter the quality of life of the prostate cancer survivor. Radical prostatectomy has traditionally been used alone when the cancer is localized to the prostate. In the event of positive margins or locally advanced disease found on pathology, adjuvant radiation therapy may offer improved survival. Surgery may also be offered when a cancer is not responding to radiation therapy. However, because radiation therapy causes tissue changes, prostatectomy after radiation has higher risks of complications. Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, LRP, is a new way to approach the prostate surgically with intent to cure. Contrasted with the open surgical form of prostate cancer surgery, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy requires a smaller incision. Relying on modern technology, such as miniaturization, fiber optics, and the like, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is a minimally invasive prostate cancer treatment but is technically demanding and seldom done in the USA. Some believe that in the hands of an experienced surgeon, robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) may reduce positive surgical margins when compared to radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) among patients with prostate cancer according to a retrospective study. The relative risk reduction was 57.7%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study (35.5% of patients had positive surgical margins following RRP), this leads to an absolute risk reduction of 20.5%. 4.9 patients must be treated for one to benefit (number needed to treat = 4.9). Other recent studies have shown RALP to result in a significantly higher rate of positive margins. Other studies showed no difference of robotic to open surgery. A recent French study comparing standard laparoscopic to robotic to open prostatectomy showed no difference in margin status or biochemical recurrence at 5 years. The relative merits of RALP and potential benefit versus open radical prostatectomy is currently an area of intense research and debate in urology. The only proven and accepted advantage to RALP is less intraoperative blood loss. Other suggested advantages beyond this lack definitive data and have not been widely accepted by the broader urological community. Transurethral resection of the prostate. Transurethral resection of the prostate, commonly called a ""TURP,"" is a surgical procedure performed when the tube from the bladder to the penis (urethra) is blocked by prostate enlargement. In general, TURP is for benign disease and is not meant as definitive treatment for prostate cancer. During a TURP, a small instrument (cystoscope) is placed into the penis and the blocking prostate is cut away. Orchiectomy. In metastatic disease, where cancer has spread beyond the prostate, removal of the testicles (called orchiectomy) may be done to decrease testosterone levels and control cancer growth. (See hormonal therapy, below). Cryosurgery. Cryosurgery is another method of treating prostate cancer in which the prostate gland is exposed to freezing temperatures. It is less invasive than radical prostatectomy, and general anesthesia is less commonly used. Under ultrasound guidance, a method invented by Dr. Gary Onik, metal rods are inserted through the skin of the perineum into the prostate. Highly purified argon gas is used to cool the rods, freezing the surrounding tissue at −186 °C (−302 °F). As the water within the prostate cells freezes, the cells die. The urethra is protected from freezing by a catheter filled with warm liquid. Impotence occurs up to ninety percent of the time. Brachytherapy. Brachytherapy for prostate cancer involves the surgical placement of radioactive 'seeds' or implants directly into the cancerous portions of the prostate, where the radiation kills the surrounding cancerous cells. It is therefore usually classified as a radiation treatment, rather than as a surgical treatment, because the actual treatment of the disease is by radiation, not surgery. See: Brachytherapy, below Complications of surgery. The most common serious complications of surgery are loss of urinary control and impotence. Reported rates of both complications vary widely depending on how they are assessed, by whom, and how long after surgery, as well as the setting (e.g., academic series vs. community-based or population-based data). Although penile sensation and the ability to achieve orgasm usually remain intact, erection and ejaculation are often impaired. Medications such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), or vardenafil (Levitra) may restore some degree of potency. For most men with organ-confined disease, a more limited ""nerve-sparing"" technique may help reduce urinary incontinence and impotence. Postoperative urinary incontinence has been reported at 16% among patients at 12 months following radical prostatectomy. Although pelvic floor muscle training has been prescribed to improve urinary continence, the evidence for efficacy in men after radical prostatectomy has come into question recently. According to information from the Men After Prostate Surgery (MAPS) randomised control trial, pelvic floor muscle training was not shown to be therapeutic or cost effective in improving urinary continence. Of the patients in the intervention group, 148 of the 196 patients reported some form of incontinence at the 12-month mark. In the control group, 151 of the 195 patients reported some urinary incontinence (EER=.755, CER=.774, RRR=.0245, ARR=.019, NNT=Not Significant). According to an online news story article in AOL Healthy Living, posted from Chicago, Illinois on Tuesday, September 20, 2011, by news writer Carla K. Johnson: ""A new study addresses one of the most worrying questions faced by men with prostate cancer: What are my chances of losing sexual function after treatment? The answers vary greatly by age, sexual potency before treatment, PSA levels and whether a man has surgery, standard radiation or radioactive seeds, the study found. Using the findings, men can get a rough idea of their personal odds by answering questions that also include weight and race, experts said. Unsurprisingly, older men whose sexual function is already low have the worst chances of good sexual function after treatment. ""This will make it possible for patients to have a more realistic view of what to expect for themselves, rather than trying to guess where they fit in overall compared to the average guy with prostate cancer,"" said study co-author Dr. Martin Sanda of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. The federally funded study, appearing in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, included only men with early-stage cancers, and it didn't address cure rates for different treatments. In the real world, some patients have limited treatment choices. For instance, only men with early-stage, slow-growing cancers can choose radioactive pellets. That means the findings may be most useful in giving a realistic picture of the sexual side effects of a treatment that's already chosen, rather than helping men pick a treatment. Researchers studied factors affecting potency in men and developed a questionnaire to help measure it. They evaluated its usefulness among 1,027 prostate cancer patients ages 38 to 84 and validated its accuracy in a separate group of more than 1,900 men. It correctly predicted the chances of post-treatment potency in 77 percent of the men who had surgery to 90 percent of the men who had radiation. The study found great variation in men's odds of having firm erections after treatment. For surgery, the prospects for maintaining top sexual function for a 50-year-old man could range from 21 percent to 70 percent, depending on his PSA level and whether a nerve-sparing technique was used. For standard radiation, the study found, the odds for a man keeping top sexual function ranged from 53 percent to 92 percent depending on PSA level and whether hormones were used along with radiation. The researchers couldn't find an age-related difference for standard radiation. For radiation pellets, a 60-year-old man's chances of keeping top sexual function ranged from 58 percent to 98 percent depending on race and body mass index. African-Americans and trimmer men had better chances. The study has some deficiencies, experts said. It didn't include men who chose what's called ""active surveillance"", where a doctor keeps track of a tumor through regular tests and treats it only if the cancer markedly worsens. Many prostate cancer patients with slow-growing tumors can live their whole lives without symptoms or treatment, said Dr. Durado Brooks, prostate cancer director for the American Cancer Society. They die of something else before the cancer kills them. ""There are a lot of prostate cancers that are not likely to benefit from treatment,"" Brooks said. Including an active surveillance group would have shown how much sexual function changes because of factors other than treatment, such as age and general health, he said. Most patients treated for early-stage prostate cancer survive, so the common side effects of treatment – incontinence and sexual problems – have become more important for patients making choices."" Radiation therapy. Overview. Radiation therapy, also known as radiotherapy, is often used to treat all stages of prostate cancer. It is also often used after surgery if the surgery was not successful at curing the cancer. Radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation to kill prostate cancer cells. When absorbed in tissue, Ionizing radiation such as gamma and x-rays damage the DNA in cancer cells, which increases the probability of apoptosis (cell death). Normal cells are able to repair radiation damage, while cancer cells are not. Radiation therapy exploits this fact to treat cancer. Two different kinds of radiation therapy are used in prostate cancer treatment: external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy (specifically prostate brachytherapy). External beam radiation therapy. External beam radiation therapy uses a linear accelerator to produce high-energy x-rays that are directed in a beam towards the prostate. A technique called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) may be used to adjust the radiation beam to conform with the shape of the tumor, allowing higher doses to be given to the prostate and seminal vesicles with less damage to the bladder and rectum. External beam radiation therapy is generally given over several weeks, with daily visits to a radiation therapy center. New types of radiation therapy such as IMRT have fewer side effects than traditional treatment. Eleven centers in the United States are now using proton therapy for prostate cancer, which uses protons rather than X-rays to kill the cancer cells. Researchers are also studying types of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to treat prostate cancer. Brachytherapy. Permanent implant brachytherapy is a popular treatment choice for patients with low to intermediate risk features, can be performed on an outpatient basis, and is associated with good 10-year outcomes with relatively low morbidity It involves the placement of about 100 small ""seeds"" containing radioactive material (such as iodine-125 or palladium-103) with a needle through the skin of the perineum directly into the tumor while under spinal or general anesthetic. These seeds emit lower-energy X-rays which are only able to travel a short distance. Although the seeds eventually become inert, they remain in the prostate permanently. The risk of exposure to others from men with implanted seeds is generally accepted to be insignificant. However, men are encouraged to talk to their doctors about any special temporary precautions around small children and pregnant women. Uses. Radiation therapy is commonly used in prostate cancer treatment. It may be used instead of surgery or after surgery in early stage prostate cancer (adjuvant radiotherapy). Radiation treatments also can be combined with hormonal therapy for intermediate risk disease, when surgery or radiation therapy alone is less likely to cure the cancer. Some radiation oncologists combine external beam radiation and brachytherapy for intermediate to high-risk situations. Radiation therapy is often used in conjunction with hormone therapy for high-risk patients. Others use a ""triple modality"" combination of external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and hormonal therapy. In advanced stages of prostate cancer, radiation is used to treat painful bone metastases or reduce spinal cord compression. Radiation therapy is also used after radical prostatectomy either for cancer recurrence or if multiple risk factors are found during surgery. Radiation therapy delivered immediately after surgery when risk factors are present (positive surgical margin, extracapsular extension, seminal vessicle involvement) has been demonstrated to reduce cancer recurrence, decrease distant metastasis, and increase overall survival in two separate randomized trials. Side effects. Side effects of radiation therapy might occur after a few weeks into treatment. Both types of radiation therapy may cause diarrhea and mild rectal bleeding due to radiation proctitis, as well as potential urinary incontinence and impotence. Symptoms tend to improve over time except erections which typically worsen as time progresses. A new method to reduce rectal radiation injury in prostate cancer patients involves the use of an absorbable spacer placed between the prostate and rectum. Such spacers are commercially available in some regions, and are undergoing clinical trials in others. By temporarily altering the anatomy these products have the potential to allow for improved cancer targeting while minimizing risk to neighboring healthy tissues. Prostate Rectum Spacers should be compatible with all prostate cancer radiotherapy treatments including 3D conformal, IMRT and stereotactic radiation and brachytherapy. Comparison to surgery. Multiple retrospective analyses have demonstrated that overall survival and disease-free survival outcomes are similar between radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy. Rates for impotence when comparing radiation to nerve-sparing surgery are similar. Radiation has lower rates of incontinence compared with surgery, but has higher rates of occasional mild rectal bleeding. Men who have undergone external beam radiation therapy may have a slightly higher risk of later developing colon cancer and bladder cancer. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). HIFU was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain, prostate, spleen, liver, kidney, breast, and bone. HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high-intensity focused ultrasound to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue, thus destroying the cancerous cells. In essence, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer, with minimal risks of affecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100 °C (212 °F). The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively) According to preliminary international studies, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects. Studies using HIFU machine have shown that 94% of patients with a pretreatment PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) of less than 10 ng/mL were cancer-free after three years. However, many studies of HIFU to 2005 were performed by manufacturers of HIFU devices, or members of manufacturers' advisory panels. Today 2000?, the HIFU procedure for prostate cancer is performed using a transrectal probe. This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. HIFU is currently not approved for medical use in the United States. Current NCCN guidelines for the treatment of prostate cancer do not include HIFU as part of standard of care, though many promising clinical trials exist. Many patients have received the HIFU procedure at facilities in Canada, and Central, and South America. Contraindications to HIFU for prostate cancer include a prostate volume larger than 40 grams, which can prevent targeted HIFU waves from reaching the anterior and anterobasal regions of the prostate, anatomic or pathologic conditions that may interfere with the introduction or displacement of the HIFU probe into the rectum, and high-volume calcification within the prostate, which can lead to HIFU scattering and transmission impairment. A 2012 UK trial of focal HIFU on 41 patients reported no histological evidence of cancer in 77% of men treated (95% confidence interval: 61 - 89%) at 12 month targeted biopsy, and a low rate of genitourinary side effects. However, this does not necessarily mean that 77% of men were definitively cured of prostate cancer, since systematic and random sampling errors are present in the biopsy process, and therefore recurrent or previously undetected cancer can be missed. In addition, the study size was small; the number of patients was chosen in order to assess side effects. However, a larger trial is currently recruiting patients (NCT01194648), the results of which will hopefully shed more light on the level of cancer control achievable using this technique. Palliative care. Palliative care for advanced stage prostate cancer focuses on extending life and relieving the symptoms of metastatic disease. As noted above, Abiraterone Acetate is showing some promise in treating advance-stage prostate cancer. It causes a dramatic reduction in PSA levels and Tumor sizes in aggressive advanced-stage prostate cancer for 70% of patients. Chemotherapy may be offered to slow disease progression and postpone symptoms. The most commonly used regimen combines the chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel with a corticosteroid such as prednisone. One study showed that treatment with docetaxel with prednisone prolonged life from 16.5 months for those taking mitoxantrone and prednisone to 18.9 months for those taking docetaxel + prednisone. Bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid have been shown to delay skeletal complications such as fractures or the need for radiation therapy in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Alpharadin is a new alpha emitting pharmaceutical targeting bone metastasis. The phase II testing shows prolonged patient survival times, reduced pain, and improved quality of life. Bone pain due to metastatic disease is treated with opioid pain relievers such as morphine and oxycodone. External beam radiation therapy directed at bone metastases may provide pain relief. Injections of certain radioisotopes, such as strontium-89, phosphorus-32, or samarium-153, also target bone metastases and may help relieve pain. Alternative therapies. As an alternative to active surveillance or definitive treatments, other therapies are also under investigation for the management of prostate cancer. PSA has been shown to be lowered in men with apparent localized prostate cancer using a vegan diet (fish allowed), regular exercise, and stress reduction. These results have so far proven durable after two-years' treatment. However, this study did not compare the vegan diet to either active surveillance or definitive treatment, and thus cannot comment on the comparative efficacy of the vegan diet in treating prostate cancer. Many other single agents have been shown to reduce PSA, slow PSA doubling times, or have similar effects on secondary markers in men with localized cancer in short term trials, such as pomegranate juice or genistein, an isoflavone found in various legumes. The potential of using multiple such agents in concert, let alone combining them with lifestyle changes, has not yet been studied. A more thorough review of natural approaches to prostate cancer has been published. Neutrons have been shown to be superior to X-rays in a the treatment of prostatic cancer. The rationale is that tumours containing hypoxic cells (cells with enough oxygen concentration to be viable, yet not enough to be X-ray-radiosensitive) and cells deficient in oxygen are resistant to killing by X-rays. Thus, the lower Oxygen Enhancement Ratio (OER) of neutrons confers an advantage. Also, neutrons have a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for slow-growing tumours than X-rays, allowing for an advantage in tumour cell killing. Prevention. Neither selenium nor vitamin E have been found to be effective in preventing prostate cancer. Exercise, genetics, and prostate cancer progression rates. In a Wednesday, February 1, 2012 online press release by Jason Bardi from the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) Newsroom, it was stated that,: ""Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) have identified nearly 200 genes in the healthy prostate tissue of men with low-grade prostate cancer that may help explain how physical activity improves survival from the disease. The study compared the activity of some 20,000 genes in healthy prostate tissue biopsied from several dozen patients. The finding builds on two studies last year by UCSF and Harvard. Research has indicated that frequent exercise such as brisk walking can delay the progress of prostate cancer  "
wikipedia-23886425," Cheetah reintroduction in India  Reintroduction of the cheetah in India involves the artificial re-establishment of a population of cheetahs into areas where they had previously existed but were hunted into extinction by the British colonial officers and Indian royalty. A part of the reintroduction process is the identification and restoration of their former grassland scrub forest habitats. This is within the scope of the duties of the local forest department of each State, where relocation occurs, through the use of Indian Central Government funding. Background. History. Until the 20th century, the Asiatic cheetah was quite common and roamed all the way from Arabia to Iran, Afghanistan and India. In India, they ranged as far south as the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. The Asiatic cheetah, also known as the ""hunting leopard"" in India was kept by kings and princes to hunt gazelle; the Moghul emperor Akbar kept them for hunting gazelle and blackbucks. He was said to have had 1,000 cheetahs at one time for assisting in his royal hunts. Trapping of large numbers of adult Indian cheetahs, who had already learned hunting skills from wild mothers, for assisting in royal hunts is said to be another major cause of the species rapid decline in India as they never bred in captivity with only one record of a litter ever. Extinction. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the species was already heading for extinction in many areas. The last physical evidence of the Asiatic cheetah in India was three shot by the Maharajah of Surguja in 1947 in eastern Madhya Pradesh, a man also noted for holding a record for shooting 1,360 tigers. In India in the mid-20th century, prey was abundant, and cheetahs fed on the blackbuck, the chinkara, and sometimes the chital and the nilgai. With the death of the last remaining population of the Asiatic cheetah in India, the species was declared extinct in India; it is the only animal in recorded history to become extinct from India due to unnatural causes. A consequence of the extinction of the cheetahs and subsequently the Indian royalty that prized them was that their grasslands homes came to be controlled, used and managed by local people. ""The grasslands faded and diminished under the hooves of a thousand cattle, they were tilled and ploughed until only a few scattered remnants were preserved in the form of wildlife sanctuaries"". Reintroduction efforts. Cloning. During the early 2000s, Indian scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, proposed a plan to clone Asiatic Cheetahs obtained from Iran. India requested Iran to transport one live pair to India. If not possible, Indian scientists requested Iran to allow them to collect some live cells of the Cheetah pair in Iran itself, which can then be made into living cell lines. However, Iran refused saying that it would neither send any cheetahs to India nor would they allow Indian scientists to collect their tissue samples. It is said that Iran wanted an Asiatic lion in exchange for a cheetah and that India was not willing to export any of its Asiatic lions. But, the Indian government has again contacted Iran to explore the possibility of Iran supplying cheetahs to help to re-establish their presence on the subcontinent decades after they were hunted to extinction. The Iranian embassy in Delhi said its government was in the process of ""arranging"" talks. Possible reintroduction sites. Currently, wildlife experts have shortlisted three regions which have the potential to support cheetah populations. The Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary and Kuno-Palpur Wildlife Sanctuaries in Madhya Pradesh and the Shahgarh bulge landscape in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan have been declared potentially suitable for the reintroduction of the cheetah. The Kuno-Palpur Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh has the potential to hold populations of all four of India's big cats; the tiger, the leopard, the Asiatic lion and the cheetah, all four of which have co-existed in the same habitats historically, before they were wiped out due to overhunting and habitat destruction. Since the Shahgarh Landscape is fenced along the Indo-Pakistani border region, the addition of more fencing will ensure adequate protection for the cheetah population. The Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary (1197km2) is part of a much larger forested landscape (5500km2 ) which can host the cheetah as well. At a future date, when sufficient population has built up, other former range habitats in India (after revitalizing them) may also be considered for reintroduction like the Banni grasslands and Desert National Park etc. A few wildlife groups have suggested the Moyar river valley in Tamil Nadu's Satyamangalam FD, part of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve as it is a pristine forest with flourishing population of prey and a good record of conservation. Frederick Augustus Nicholson, the then British Collector has reported to have shot a few individuals near Kothamangalam, Velamundi and Bolampatti (all in NBR). This region is on the leeward side of SW monsoon. Genetic sub-species level differentiation. Asiatic cheetah ""(Acinonyx jubatus venaticus)"" has, for a long time, been ""theoretically"" classified as a sub-species of the cheetah with the suffix """"venaticus"""" applied at the end of its scientific binomial name ""Acinonyx jubatus"". However, at a Cheetah reintroduction workshop organised in India on 9 September 2009, Stephen J. O'Brien from Laboratory of Genomic Diversity of National Cancer Institute, USA who has in the past conducted numerous prestigious genetic studies - including those on Asiatic lions - said that according to the latest modern genetic studies, it was discovered that the Asiatic cheetah was, in fact, genetically identical to the African Cheetah with which it had separated only about 5000 years ago. This was not enough time for a sub-species level differentiation; O'Brien said that in comparison the Asian and African lion subspecies were separated some 100,000 years ago, as was the African and Asian leopard subspecies 169,000 years ago. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker of the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) and other wildlife experts advised the Indian Government that for reintroduction purposes India should source the Cheetah from Africa where they were much more numerous instead of trying to have some removed from the critically endangered low population of about 70 to 100 or so Asiatic Cheetahs left in Iran. India's Union Minister of State for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh, chief wildlife wardens of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, officials of the environment ministry, cheetah experts from across the globe including Laurie Marker from Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), representatives from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) including Yadvendradev Jhala, and IUCN, an international conservation NGO, among others, participated in a meeting about this issue. The conference was organised by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) Subsequently, in 2011, a much more detailed five year genetic study involving gathering of DNA samples from the wild, zoos and museums in eight countries was published in ""Molecular Ecology (Journal)"" on 8 January 2011. This newer study concluded that African and Asiatic cheetahs were in reality genetically very distinct and had in fact separated 32,000 to 67,000 years ago. Sub-species level differentiation had taken place due to longer separation from the African population. The effect of this latest revelation on India's plan to reintroduce cheetahs to the country is yet unknown. Introduction of African cheetah. As the world's last Asiatic cheetah population in Iran is currently classified as critically endangered, with an estimated total of below 100, the cheetah experts felt that it would not be conducive to disturb it. India is therefore exploring an alternate plan of importing the African Cheetah (""Acinonyx jubatus"") from some African countries where they are in greater abundance, with a view to breeding them in captivity and then setting them free in protected, semi-arid habitats in India. Since the Asiatic Cheetah went extinct in India about half a century ago, suggestions to reestablish the cheetah in India have been ongoing but this is the first time that a major conservation NGO like Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) has taken it on them and are currently spearheading the Cheetah reintroduction plan in India in collaboration with Wildlife Institute of India (WII). For this purpose a meeting of International cheetah experts was organized in Gajner, near Bikaner in the Indian state of Rajasthan during September 2009. As per the discussions held at the meeting cheetah experts from around the world favored importing African cheetahs from Africa for the proposed reintroduction in India as against getting them from the world's last remnant population of Asiatic Cheetah, also called Iranian cheetah, that only survive in Iran which are currently critically endangered with their entire population estimated to be below 100. International experts including Laurie Marker of Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), credited with developing cheetah conservation programmes in a number of countries, including Iran, argues that the world's last Asiatic cheetah population in Iran is abysmally low to spare any individuals for reintroduction efforts in India. Stephen J O'Brien, world's leading conservation geneticist and Chief of the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA, has clarified that there is no significant genetic difference between the African and the Iran's Asiatic cheetah, as per genetic research carried out by him African and Indian cheetahs were only separated just some 5,000 years ago which is not enough for a sub-species level differentiation. ""African and Asian cheetahs are similar in nature and have same genetic make-up. So India can have the animal from South Africa if it is not getting from Iran (which has already refused to part with its Asian cheetah),"" noted the cheetah genetic expert Stephen J O Brien. At the meeting experts also identified South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Tanzania and UAE as countries from where the cheetah could be imported for India. ""About 5 to 10 animals annually have to be brought to India over a period of 5 to 10 years,"" recommended another working group, which was formed for exploring sourcing and translocation of the cheetah. The Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India has approved the recommendation for a detailed survey of potential reintroduction sites in the four Indian states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, shortlisted during the consultative meeting. Three more Indian states Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra are being also considered. This survey will form the basis for the roadmap of reintroduction of cheetah in India, and will be carried out by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), in collaboration with the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and the concerned state governments with their respective forest departments. Current status. The Ministry of forests and environment of India is now hammering out the details of the cheetah conservation plan. As a first step, a two-day seminar of technical experts on cheetahs was held in Gajner from 9 September 2009. Experts on cheetah, including Divyabhanusinh and M K Ranjitsinh presented their papers on how to go about bringing cheetahs to India. The initial plans were to bring the cheetahs to Gajner Wildlife Sanctuary. ""We want to set up a breeding ground for the cheetahs and Gajner seems to fit the bill perfectly. Thereafter, they will be transported to various states,"" he added. India is also in talks with the Islamic Republic of Iran over the possibility of sending a pair of Asiatic cheetahs to India. It is said that Iran wanted an Asiatic lion in exchange for a cheetah and that India wasn't ready to export any of its Asiatic lions. The Iranian embassy in Delhi said that its government was in the process of ""arranging"" talks. The Union Minister of State for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh said that African cheetahs could be brought to India within three years having just returned from a trip to South Africa, one of the potential source-habitats of cheetahs to be moved to India. The Wildlife Institute of India is spearheading the project, and will unveil a road map and destination for the African cheetahs — possible options are in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat — by the end of May. Kuno Palpur and Nauradehi Sancturies in Madhya Pradesh and Shahgarh landscape in Jaisalmer in Rajasthan have been selected in by the Wildlife Institute of India as most suitable sites for the reintroduction project. Plans on hold. As of May 2012 the Indian Supreme Court has put the project of importing Cheetahs from Africa and reintroducing them in India on hold. Some Conservationists have been fighting a legal battle in Indian Supreme Court to get the Indian State Government of Gujarat to break its monopolizing of wild Asiatic Lions and release a few overpopulated prides of Asiatic lions spilling out of Gir National Park for reintroduction in the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in the neighbouring Indian State of Madhya Pradesh which was prepared for them after relocating over 24 villages out of the forest. In the past, for last two decades the State Government of Gujarat had concocted every possible reason to maintain its monopoly on wild Asiatic Lions and the tourism revenue generated by them and of recent Gujarat's legal council had put forward the argument that Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary is being used for the introduction of African Cheetah which might take several years to fully settle down and repopulate the area and hence reintroduction of Asiatic Lions should only be done after that, this scared the conservationists that Gujarat will use this pretext to delay the reintroduction of native Asiatic Lions by many more decades using the Cheetah argument. Indian Supreme court has taken note of the arguments put forth by some Indian conservationists that importing African Cheetah for reintroduction in India is misguided as it is against IUCN reintroduction guidelines and no clearance had been sought from India's National Board for Wildlife. The Indian Supreme Court has put the project on hold till further notice asking for clearance from India's National Board for Wildlife, meantime it has fast tracked the case for the re-introduction of Asiatic Lions to Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary and is hearing it every Monday. Senior advocate PS Narasimha, court-appointed adviser and the amicus curiae in the Asiatic lion relocation case in India's Supreme Court, filed an application seeking a stay on the implementation of African cheetah reintroduction project in India. The Indian Supreme court granted the stay and the matter has been scheduled for further hearing in July 2012 after the court returns from vacation. During its hearings, the Bench was informed that India's Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) has decided to introduce the African cheetah from Namibia into Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, the same proposed habitat being developed as the second home for the translocation of Asiatic Lions from Gir Wildlife Sanctuary in the neighbouring Indian state of Gujarat which did not want to shift any Asiatic Lions out of the state. Narasimha said the proposal for reintroduction of African Cheetah ""has not been either placed before the Standing Committee of India's National Board for Wildlife, nor has there been a considered decision taken in this regard"". He stated in an application that ""scientific studies show that the African Cheetahs and Asian Cheetahs are completely different, both genetically and also in their characteristics"" and the reintroduction of African Cheetah in India was also against the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) guidelines on translocation of wildlife species. ""In fact, the (IUCN) guidelines categorically warn against the introduction of alien or exotic species. The African Cheetah obviously never existed in India. Therefore, it is not case of intentional movement of an organism into a part of its native range,"" the application stated. Asiatic Cheetah became extinct in India in the 1950s, In the past, India's last recorded cheetah in the wild was said to have been shot in the Rewa area of Madhya Pradesh in the late 1940s. It was mentioned that the introduction of alien or exotic species is universally shunned by wildlife experts and ""in fact countries such as South Africa, Australia are spending huge amount of funds to eradicate and remove exotic wildlife species from wilderness areas or wild habitats"". Narasimha also sought a direction of India's Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to produce before the apex court all relevant records and decisions relating to introduction of cheetah. He said the Indian Cheetah in genetic composition is a different animal than the African Cheetah and a different sub species altogether and ""therefore one cannot be introduced in place of the other"". Conservationists say fewer than 100 of the critically endangered Asiatic Cheetah subspecies remain only in Iran, roaming the central deserts. The vast majority of the 10,000 cheetahs left in the world are in Africa. "

He assumed that role on August 10 of that year. He was recruited by Jim Millstein who was Chief Restructuring Officer at the US Department of Treasury.  During his first meeting with employees, Benmosche stated that Congress was composed of ""crazies,"" that he would not cooperate if asked to testify before Congress, and that New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who had investigated AIG, ""doesn't deserve to be in government."" He later asked for a personal private jet and said that he might quit over government-imposed pay restrictions. In 2010, Benmosche testified to the Congressional Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Oversight Panel, on May 26 , that AIG would repay the U.S. Government and American taxpayers’ investment in AIG in full, with a profit. “AIG is now on a clear path to repaying taxpayers ... At the end of the day, the U.S. government will make an appropriate profit,” he testified.  Benmosche oversaw the sale of non-core assets in AIG’s portfolio to pay down the $182 billion in government aid. Business units such as American Life Insurance Company (Alico), American General Finance, 21st Century Insurance, Nan Shan and AIA were sold.

Overcoming Cancer. In 2010, Benmosche was diagnosed with cancer. He continued to work while also undergoing an aggressive oral chemotherapy regime.  In an interview with Charlie Rose in December 2012, Benmosche said that he will stay at his current position for two more years. Controversy. In September 2013, Benmosche gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal in which he compared public outrage over AIG bonuses to the lynching of black Americans, saying the uproar ""was intended to stir public anger, to get everybody out there with their pitch forks and their hangman nooses, and all that–sort of like what we did in the Deep South ago. And I think it was just as bad and just as wrong."" This was seen as a reference to the $165 million in bonuses paid out in March 2009 to employees of AIG's ""financial products"" division, which sold the credit derivatives that put AIG deeply in debt after the Lehman Brothers collapse and compelled the Federal Reserve to ""bailout"" AIG with a $85 billion loan six months earlier.His comments have been labeled offensive by a number of commentators.

It was released on 28 September 2009 by Epic Records. Its first two singles from the album, ""Stone Cold Sober"" and ""New York"", both peaked within the top twenty in the United Kingdom. The album spawned three more singles: ""Do You Want the Truth or Something Beautiful?"", ""Upside Down"" and ""Smoke & Mirrors"". The album received positive reviews from critics. Since its release, the album spent 106 weeks on the UK Albums Chart and peaked at number 9. It was announced on 1 March 2013 that the album had been certified 2× Platinum with sales exceeding 600,000 copies. To promote the album Faith embarked her first concert Do You Want the Truth or Something Beautiful Tour in 12 February 2010 which visited Europe. Background. During her time at college, Faith worked in a pub where the manager asked her to front his band, which they later called 'Paloma and the Penetrators'. During a performance with the band at a cabaret show, Faith was scouted by an A&R man from Epic Records, who invited Faith to sing for the manager of the label. Twenty minutes into the audition, Faith asked the manager to turn his phone off and when he refused, she walked out. Epic A&R Joanna Charrington told HitQuarters ""When she played a showcase for us it was clear that she was a star but the material was a bit generic. She didn't have the hit songs."" Not being one hundred percent convinced the label executives to decide to wait. During this time Charrington regularly checked Faith's MySpace page ""to see if she had something that had a special direction or sound."" After several months her attention was eventually piqued by ""Broken Doll"", which she thought was a well-crafted song with a ""fantastic chorus and brilliant lyrics."" Charrington told Epic managing director Nick Raphael ""I think we should get this girl back in. She sounds like she is getting it now. We can help her get the songs."" Faith revealed in an interview that the manager called her and offered her a contract saying he had seen many acts since and none had been as memorable as her. Critical reception. Andy Gill from The Independent said: ""In the case of this impressive debut album, that might refer to her fabricated Amy Winehouse persona, which is a touch too smoothly effected to ring entirely true. It's there right from the off with the Amy/Duffy retro-soul stylings of ""Stone Cold Sober""; while her claim in ""Broken Doll"" that she's ""damaged goods"" seems that bit too eager to echo Amy's admission ""I told you I was trouble"". But Paloma deals in similarly grand, melodramatic emotions in songs such as ""Smoke And Mirrors"", ""New York"" and the title-track, wheeling out Spectorian tubular bells and keening string glissandi to evoke the depths of her emotional catastrophe"". Robyn Burrows from ""Contact Music"" stated, ""With obvious comparisons to Amy Winehouse and even Duffy by some, Faith was always going to need to set herself apart from her contemporaries for the critics. She more than does that on this record."" ""Opening with ""Stone Cold Sober"", a retro pop gem that puts bands like the Noisettes firmly in their place the album jumps from tempo to tempo with elements of pop and jazz but keeping that smooth soul sound throughout."" ""Despite her very distinctive vocals, the album keeps your attention throughout with its varied tracks. The beautiful soaring epic ""New York"" with her backing singers shows a strong confident character with a voice to match. Whereas the fragile ""Broken Doll"", where Faith sings 'I don't seem to be perfect, I know I'm damaged goods' shows us a different side of the singer. ""Upside Down"" increases the tempo as it bounces along to its jazz melody for three minutes. The album ends with two longer tracks, ""My Legs Are Weak"" and the almost choral backing singers on ""Play On"", perhaps a little too long in comparison with the rest of the tracks but finishing with a lush display of Faith's vocal range."" ""The only negative thing I could find with this album is its length, a little under 40 minutes. But it is a real soul pop classic, with each track earning its place. Musically diverse and well produced; it is a polished diamond. Faith's captivating vocals and huge range keep you hooked throughout and encourage you to press repeat as soon as the album ends."" On the BBC Music Review ""Mike Diver"" stated, ""Faith's voice is the first element of these sumptuous arrangements to strike, its idiosyncratic ticks and sharp inflections separating her from the pack in the same way as Duffy – but while the Welsh star's vocals can lack a sincere conveyance of the emotions behind a song, Faith's sentiments are never in doubt, even on the surprisingly underwhelming (in context) singles Stone Cold Sober and New York. The former sounds designed to soundtrack an advertisement – successfully, as it turns out – and the latter's lamenting loses some of its edge when one's unsure if the New York in question is a rival lover or, literally, the city that never sleeps. Whichever it is, it's stolen our protagonist's lover away"". Chart performance. ""Do You Want the Truth or Something Beautiful?"" peaked at number 9 in the UK. In just under 2 months of the album being released, it received a Gold certification with sales over 100,000, later being certified as Platinum. The album stayed in the UK top 100 albums chart for 62 weeks, in its 63rd week it fell out the top 100 albums to no. 110, however the week after charted back into the top 100.

wikipedia-23886984," Philippine Fault System  The Philippine Fault System is an inter-related system of faults throughout the whole of the Philippine Archipelago, primarily caused by tectonic forces compressing the Philippines into what tectonic geophysicists call the Philippine Mobile Belt. Philippine Mobile Belt. The Philippine Mobile Belt is composed of a large number of accretionary blocks and strips. Most strips are long and narrow like the Zambales ophiolites which is at least 400 km long and 50 km wide. The strips generally run north-south and the zones of convergence are usually demarcated by fault lines. The Philippine Mobile Belt is compressed on the west by the Eurasian Plate and two arms of the Sunda Plate, and on the east by the Philippine Sea Plate. These tectonic plates have compressed and lifted parts of the Philippines causing extensive faulting, primarily on a north-south axis. All faults in the Philippines are inter-related by the tectonic forces causative of the Philippine Mobile Belt, or its tectonic induced volcanism. A more complete understanding can be gained by viewing the faults in the Philippines as an inter-related Philippine Fault System. Philippine Fault. The main fault runs most of the length of the Philippines and is called the Philippine Fault (see Gallery). It extends from Davao Gulf in the south, bisects CARAGA region at the Agusan River basin, crosses to Leyte and Masbate islands, and traverses Quezon province in eastern Luzon before passing through Nueva Ecija up to the Ilocos region in northwest Luzon. Here, the fault has become braided and is no longer single. The Philippine Fault, probably active since the Middle Miocene is a recent example of the north-south strike-slip fault zones of Luzon. The N150E segment, which breaks the meridian continuity of the Philippine Fault system in Luzon, is located to the west of Benham Plateau on the western edge of the Philippine Sea Plate. The N150E fault probably has a recent genesis and could be a mechanism to absorb backwards the convergence between Benham Plateau and the east Luzon arc.  Following the major 1990 Luzon earthquake, scientists reconsidered their fault models and following the lead of Pinet and Stephan (1989), thought it likely that Benham Plateau is still displacing central Luzon and the Philippine Fault System to the west, and so caused the 1990 Luzon earthquake. The 20 second or 50 second wave in the 1990 quake developed a new east-west sub-fault, which terminated disastrously at Baguio. "
wikipedia-23887081," Abandoned pets  Abandoned pets are both exotic pets and companion animals that are either inadvertently or purposely cast off by their owners. This commonly occurs when an owner passes away, or when a pet becomes disruptive or grows too large. The financial crisis of 2007–2010 has resulted in a number of pets abandoned for economic reasons. Typical of this group are pets left behind when the owner's home is foreclosed. These animals can be left alone on the property or dropped off at a shelter. They are often discovered after the foreclosure process, when the realtor or bank enters the home. Animals fortunate enough to survive until they are discovered are often in poor condition due to lack of resources such as food and water. Abandonment. Pets are abandoned for a variety of reasons. Often, when abandoned, pets are forced to fend for themselves, and become feral. In particular, cats and dogs go to colonies. Feral cats are said to outnumber feral dogs. Feral cats are difficult to deal with, as often they become impossible to socialize enough to be re-introduced to a new human owner. In general, only newly abandoned cats and very young feral kittens can be tamed. Foreclosure pets. Currently the exact number of foreclosure pets is unknown. People often drop animals off at a shelter and claim they are moving, when in fact they are leaving due to foreclosure. However, it is thought the numbers are climbing due to high foreclosure rates. As homeowners run out of time and options, they often leave their animals behind. The animals are then classified as abandoned foreclosure pets. The pets left behind in homes are often left without food or water. Some do not survive because of the lack of resources and are found dead when realtors or banks enter the premises. The animals are put in harm's way, and it is often believed it is done as a way to retaliate against those who took the home away. Pets are not able to survive in the wild without resources, which means they are at a disadvantage whenever they are left without humans to watch over them. Many are left to starve or become dehydrated. Shelters. Many animals left at a shelter are euthanized due to lack of space and financial resources for these animals. Shelters unable to raise additional funds to provide for the increased number of incoming animals have no choice but to euthanize them, sometimes within days. "

In addition to continuing to make her videos and other media appearances, she currently teaches a quarter of the classes and oversees 13 other instructors at the studio, which has become profitable enough for her to consider opening a branch. Deepak Chopra and Jane Fonda are among her students; the former considers her his personal instructor. ""I have been doing yoga for 30 years,"" he says. ""I have had teachers of all kinds. Taking lessons from her has been more useful to me than taking yoga from anyone else."" Stiles does not follow any school of yoga or instructor and focuses purely on its physical aspects and health benefits, with no philosophical or spiritual dimension. She eschews the Sanskrit names for yoga positions and does not ask students to chant. She hires instructors without regard to the certification process normally required elsewhere, preferring to assess them by watching them teach, although Strala does offer a teacher-training program. Strala's per-class fee, $10, is lower than other Manhattan yoga studios.  Her goal is to make yoga more accessible. ""People need yoga, not another religious leader. Quite often in New York, they want to be religious leaders, and it's not useful"", she explains. ""I was never invited to the party anyway—so I started my own party"". Too many people outside yoga, she believes, see it as ""something Jennifer Aniston does"". Fonda has praised ""her ability to make yoga accessible to people who might be scared of it or think it might be too esoteric"". Stiles says she receives letters regularly from people, such as military men, who do her videos but are afraid to go to a yoga studio. ""This studio is the first place I have felt comfortable"", one Strala student told ""The New York Times"". ""It doesn't feel like it's all 26-year-old former dancers."" Stiles' approach to yoga has met with some controversy in the yoga community. Jennilyn Carson of the popular YogaDork blog reports that some practitioners consider it ""disrespect to what the practice is"" for Stiles to promote it as a weight-loss method. ""I don't care what Tara Stiles says yoga is,"" another yogini says. ""It's not about making your body beautiful."" Yoga traditionalists have also complained about her willingness to draw on her modeling background and exploit sex appeal in yoga-wear advertisements and her videos, some of which she has appeared in wearing short shorts and a tank top. ""Who made these rules?"", Stiles has responded. ""I feel like I'm standing up for yoga."" To critics of her videos and photo shoots, she says, ""We should not be hiding behind our bodies. should be empowering."" Television. Stiles was a contestant and winner of MTV's Fear episode 9, ""Fort Gains"". She has also appeared in Matthew Barney's ""The Cremaster Cycle: Cremester 3"". She co-hosted three segments on on fitness and fashion with Pedro Andrade, Siafa Lewis, and Margherita Missoni. "

wikipedia-23976205," Doctor Steel  Doctor Steel (full name, Doctor Phineas Waldolf Steel) was a self-published American musician and internet personality from Los Angeles. He performed on rare occasions with a ""backup band"", claiming that a fictitious robot band had malfunctioned. Shows incorporated puppetry, multimedia and performances by female members (""Nurses"" and ""Scouts"") of his street team, The Army of Toy Soldiers. Steel made a brief appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" and has had numerous interviews. He was the subject of an article in Wired Magazine regarding allegations that Dr. Horrible had copied his style. Steel has frequently been cited as an example of Steampunk music. Musical career. Steel began publicly performing in 1999, essentially busking on the streets of Los Angeles. A few years later, he began performing at venues like The Key Club and the CIA. His live shows combined music with puppetry and video projection that reflect the stories and meanings of the songs. In 2001 and 2002, the albums ""Dr. Steel"" (2001), ""Dr. Steel II: Eclectic Boogaloo"" (2001), and ""People of Earth"" (2002) were released digitally to iTunes, Amazon and other stores. ""The Dr. Steel Collection"" (2004) was the first CD release, featuring many tracks which were released on other albums, slightly altered. ""The Dr. Steel Collection"" also features the track ""Land of the Lost,"" about the 1970s version of the show by the same name. Some attempts were made to get the song into the soundtrack of 2009 movie version of ""Land of the Lost"", but they were unsuccessful. Steel's second CD release was ""The Dr. Steel Read-A-Long Album"" (2006). It was a limited distribution and quickly sold out. The album art included a recreation of the sleeve of read-along records, and the disc design resembled that of a vinyl record. In 2007, Steel re-released the first three albums, once again in digital format. Steel's music can often be heard on a number of steampunk radio broadcasts that stream worldwide, such as The Clockwork Cabaret. His song ""Boogieman Boogie"" was also included in a compilation of steampunk music released by Gilded Age Records. Musical style. Steel's music is eclectic in genre, often combining the noise and distortion of industrial with aspects of European folk, classical, and even jazz, as well as hip-hop and opera. Many songs feature samples from vintage public service announcements and educational films, such as Duck and Cover. ""Rue Morgue Magazine"" described the sound as ""Industrial Hip-Hop Opera"". cited, as some of his musical influences, Igor Stravinsky, Tom Waits, Pink Floyd, Queen, Mike Patton, Nine Inch Nails, Danny Elfman, Beck, and John Zorn. Stage persona. On stage, and in all public performances and interviews, Steel maintained the appearance of a mad scientist bent on conquering the world and becoming the future World Emperor. He claimed to be a former toymaker who, in a fit of rage over being fired for creating drastic designs such as babies with buzzsaws for hands, burned down the factory he worked at and was committed to a psychiatric institution. This back-story relates that Steel escaped the sanitarium and retreated to a deserted island laboratory, where he became bent on world conquest in order to create a ""Utopian Playland"" where his toy designs could be enjoyed. As a mad scientist, Steel is obsessed with conspiracy theories, giant robots, baking cupcakes and ""mind control cookies"", and experimenting with hamsters. In appearance, Steel drew on the mad scientist archetype, dressing in a white PVC lab coat (with comically large black buttons), black PVC gloves, black boots, shaved head, sinister goatee, and antique welder's goggles. When not in his ""mad scientist"" costume, Steel typically dressed in a very aristocratic neo-Victorian steampunk style, while still retaining his goggles. He was never seen without the goggles. Retirement. In 2010, Dr. Steel announced plans to begin work on a new album, entitled ""Toymonger."" However, in July 2011, after a long period of silence from him, it was announced that Doctor Steel had retired from the music industry, and a personal letter from Steel to the current head of the Army of Toy Soldiers in January 2012 confirmed this. (However, there was no other ""official"" or public announcement.) The Army of Toy Soldiers have decided to continue on as an organization, switching their focus from promoting the entertainer to promoting the philosophy he presented, such as the importance of creativity and building one's own Utopian Playland. Promotional videos and web videos. Steel also released what he called ""public service announcements"" covering philosophical subjects such as transhumanism, freedom of thought, and subjective reality. (As a transhumanist, Dr. Steel has also been interviewed on his views by the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, and has even published a paper on the subject.) Finally, the Toy Soldiers Unite website features a series of videos called ""Ask Dr. Steel"", in which Steel himself answered questions asked by Toy Soldiers. In May 2010, Doctor Steel's videos were featured in one of Veronique Chevalier's Red Velvet Variety Shows. In May 2010, Dr. Steel released a music video to his song, ""Childhood Don't a-Go-Go"", directed by Tony Leonardi III. Controversy. Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. In 2008, Joss Whedon released a short musical film online entitled ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"". Fans of Steel, and Steel himself, noted the similarities between Dr. Steel and Dr. Horrible: This attracted the attention of national media and was reported in Coilhouse and also Wired magazine, in which Dr. Horrible co-writer Maurissa Tancharoen responded, ""All we have to say on the subject is we've never heard of Dr. Steel before."" ""There’s room for everyone in this party,"" she added. Army of Toy Soldiers. The Army of Toy Soldiers (formerly Dr. Steel's Army of Toy Soldiers; also known as Toy Soldiers Unite after the name of their website) was originally the fan club and street team of steampunk entertainer Doctor Steel, and played into the Dr. Steel fiction, in that it was allegedly a tool in his plan for global domination. It is currently registered as a not-for-profit organization in Great Britain. The Army considers itself a movement for social change, and since Dr. Steel's retirement it has continued as an organization dedicated to promoting Steel's social ideals. The website for the organization, referred to playfully as the ""digital bunker"", was created by the then head of Dr.Steel's fan club, Sergeant Kato, in 2006. After Steel's retirement, most information regarding him was moved to an archive site. Structure. The Toy Soldier Army has four main regiments: Toy Soldiers, Nurses, Toy Scouts and Engineers. (Originally, the Nurse and Scout regiments were reserved for females within the Army, whereas people of any gender could belong to the Toy Soldier regiment, but after Dr. Steel's retirement this was changed, and Nurses and Scouts became open to anyone.) The Army is further divided into divisions based upon geographical location as well as divisions based on creative interests (""Special Ops""). The Army is currently led by the three head admins of the website, two residing in the US and one in the UK. There are no ranks — all Toy Soldiers are considered equal — although Toy Soldiers often give themselves fanciful ""ranks"" as part of the fun. However, Toy Soldiers who go ""above and beyond"" may be awarded the honorary title of ""Yellow Jacket"". Originally this title was given personally by Doctor Steel, but since Dr. Steel's retirement this award has been given out by the admins of the official website. To date, only 51 have achieved the status of Yellow Jacket. Uniforms. Toy Soldiers wear paramilitary ""uniforms"" with patches and color schemes, but are encouraged to design their own uniform so long as the required patches and colors are used. The basic color scheme for soldiers is black with yellow trim, although red trim may also be used sparingly. Female nurses generally wear white nurse uniforms with red trim, although a brown military uniform with garrison cap is also worn (see inset image). Scouts generally wear beige tops and black skirts or slacks. Engineers generally wear black overalls or coveralls, or black or white lab coats. The original ""traditional"" uniforms designed by Dr. Steel and Sgt. Kato were dieselpunk inspired. A new set of uniform concepts released on the Army's website in 2013, designed by Sgt. Grinner, have a decidedly more cyberpunk appearance. Operations. Toy Soldiers continue to promote Dr. Steel's philosophy, individually through ""missions"", while larger group events are known as ""operations"" or ""invasions"". Some Soldiers use their connections and access to the media for promotion, while others may choose to ""propagandize"" their school or workplace. Toy Soldiers frequently do charity and volunteer work in uniform, such as starting local clothing or toy drives and even donating to drives such as Toys for Tots, Light the Night Walk and Adopt a Highway. The Toy Soldiers have their own holiday, ""Toy Soldier Day,"" which is observed every year on March 4 (a play on ""march forth""), and simultaneous invasions of Disney theme parks worldwide take place on the nearest Saturday to this day. Promotional material (""Propaganda""). Promotional material for the Toy Soldiers is referred to as ""propaganda"". The decision to use a term with such charged connotations was a deliberate satirical allusion to famous groups in the past who had plans for world domination, in order to spotlight or ""hang a lampshade"" on the tricks of mass manipulation. Some of the material was designed and created by Steel himself (such as the ""propaganda posters"", designed to resemble WWII propaganda posters), but Steel encouraged his fans to design their own propaganda as well. Motto and Philosophy. The Army's motto, ""Building a Utopian Playland"", comes from the title of Dr. Steel's ""Propaganda Video"" of the same name, and expresses the group's core philosophy. Originally, it related to Steel's alleged plans to ""take over the world"", but also meant a metaphorical altering of one's own worldview through making having fun one's first priority and realizing one's creative potential, and the belief that if everyone did this, the world could be transformed. Steel called this concept a ""world ""make""over"". Current activities. Since the announcement of Dr. Steel's retirement, the Army of Toy Soldiers have continued on as an organization dedicated to spreading the philosophy Dr. Steel presented. The Dr. Steel ""angry face"" logo (and uniform patch) has been dropped, having been replaced with Steel's grinning robot head logo. As an artistic network, the Army strongly encourages and supports independent artists and entertainers. The Army also continues to ""invade"" comic and steampunk conventions; they have had a regular fan tables at San Diego Comic Con and MCM Expo in London for several years now. Since 2010, the Toy Soldiers have participated yearly in the Doo Dah Parade in Pasadena, CA and have become ""veteran crowd favorites."" And in 2012, several members of the UK division were invited to participate in the filming of Professor Elemental's music video, ""I'm British."" The Army also has several semi-regular podcasts, which are released under the umbrella of the Toy Soldiers' YouTube channel, ""TSU-TV"". In keeping with its nonprofit status in the UK, in 2013 the Army donated its surplus budget over operating expenses to the children's charity Child's Play. "

wikipedia-23976475," Toi gold mine  The Toi gold mine (Japanese: 土肥鉱山, also 土肥金山) was an important gold mine of Japan, located within the city of Toi, Izu Peninsula, Shizuoka Prefecture. History. Small-scale gold mining is said to have started at Toi around 1370 during the period of the Ashikaga Bakufu. The gold mine was operated on a large scale from the time of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the late 16th century. Several mines were open in 1577, but Tokugawa Ieyasu endeavored to their development from 1601. He put the exploitation of the mine under the responsibility of Gold Mine Minister (金山奉行) Ōkubo. Toi was one of several goldmines of the Izu Peninsula, such as Yugashima or Nawaji, totaling about 60 gold mines in Izu alone. The gold and silver produced by these mines permitted the production of Tokugawa coinage, and allowed for the prosperity of the Tokugawa. The city of Toi itself became highly prosperous, with numerous trades flooding in to service the workers and the administration at the gold mine, so that Toi became known as ""Toi Sengen"" (土肥千軒, ""Toi of the 1,000 shops""). The mine became less productive as it became flooded. Workers were killed because of the exhausting conditions due to seeping hot springs, and poor oxygen content of air, leading to the installation of water pumps and ventilators at numerous intervals. In 1917, gold was again discovered at the mine, and exploitation continued under the company Toi Kinzan KK. In 1931, the mine entered Sumitomo Group, and passed under Toi Kōgyō KK in 1942. The mine was ultimately closed in 1965 and then reopened for tourism. Characteristics. Toi was the second most productive gold mine in Japan, after the gold mine of Sado in Niigata Prefecture. During its period of exploitation, it produced in total 40 tons of gold and 400 tons of silver, whereas Sado produced as much as 80 tons of gold. One ton of rock would produce in average 5 to 10 grams of gold, although 30 grams ore was common, and some rock has yielded as much as 600 g of gold per ton. Galleries. The galleries of the mine total about 100 kilometers in length, over a surface of 37 hectares, and go as deep as 180 meters below sea level. The area visible for tourism is about 350m long, and goes about 150 meters deep into mountain rock. Legacy. The mine is now partially open for visits, and has become a tourist attraction. A ""Shrine of the mine gods"" (山神社) is visible inside the galleries. The Toi Gold Museum (土肥黄金館) has also been built nearby, which describes the history of the mine and gold mining in Japan. The museum received some fame for housing the world's largest gold bar, weighing 250 kg, and representing a value of about $14.7 million in January 2012. The bar obtained an official Guinness record certificate for ""The largest manufactured pure gold bar"": "
wikipedia-23976623," Production of Watchmen  Watchmen is a 2009 film based on a twelve-issue comic book limited series of same name created by writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colorist John Higgins, published by DC Comics between 1986 and 1987. The graphic novel's film rights were acquired by producer Lawrence Gordon in 1986. Many problems halted the adaptation's development, with four different studios and various directors and screenwriters being attached to the project through twenty years. In 2006, Zack Snyder, who at the time was filming another comic book adaptation, ""300"", was hired by Warner Bros. to helm ""Watchmen"". Filming started in 2007, and following deals with two of the previous companies involved in the development—Paramount Pictures, responsible for international distribution rights, and 20th Century Fox, which received the rights to part of the gross—the ""Watchmen"" adaptation was finally released in March 2009. Pre-production. Failed projects. In August 1986, producer Lawrence Gordon acquired the film rights to ""Watchmen"" for 20th Century Fox, with producer Joel Silver working on the film. Fox asked author Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story, but when Moore declined the studio enlisted screenwriter Sam Hamm. On September 9, 1988, Hamm turned in his first draft, but said that condensing a 338-page, nine-panel-a-page comic book into a 128-page script was arduous. He took the liberty of re-writing ""Watchmen""'s complicated ending into a ""more manageable"" conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox. Fox put the film into turnaround in 1991, and Gordon set up the project at a new company, Largo International, with Fox distributing the film. Although Largo closed three years later, Fox was promised that they would be involved if the project was revived. Gordon and Silver moved the project to Warner Bros., where Terry Gilliam was attached to direct. Unsatisfied with how Hamm's script fleshed out the characters, Gilliam brought in Charles McKeown to rewrite it. The second draft, which was credited to Gilliam, Warren Skaaren, and Hamm rather than McKeown, used the character Rorschach's diary as a voice-over, and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed. According to ""Watchmen"" artist Dave Gibbons, Silver wanted to cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Manhattan. Filming was to take place at Pinewood Studios. Because both Gilliam and Silver's previous films, ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" and ""Die Hard 2"" respectively, went over budget, they were only able to raise $25 million for the film—a quarter of the necessary budget. As a result, Gilliam abandoned the project, and ultimately decided that ""Watchmen"" was unfilmable. Gilliam explained, ""Reducing story to a two or two-and-a-half hour film [...] seemed to me to take away the essence of what ""Watchmen"" is about."" When Warner Bros. dropped the project, Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently. The director again declined, believing that the comic book would be better directed as a five-hour miniseries. In October 2001, Gordon and Universal Studios signed screenwriter David Hayter to write and direct ""Watchmen"" in a ""seven-figure deal"". Hayter hoped to begin filming in early 2002, but did not turn in his first draft until July 2002. In May 2003, Hayter said he had Alan Moore's blessing on the film, despite Moore's disagreement with the project since its first incarnation. In July 2003, ""Watchmen"" producer Lloyd Levin announced the completion of Hayter's script, which he called ""a great adaptation [...] that absolutely ""celebrates"" the book"". Ultimately, Hayter and the producers left Universal over creative differences, and in October 2003, Gordon and Levin expressed interest in setting up ""Watchmen"" at Revolution Studios. The pair intended to shoot the film in Prague, but the project fell apart at Revolution Studios. In July 2004, it was announced Paramount Pictures would produce ""Watchmen"", and they hired Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter's script. Gordon and Levin remained attached, collaborating with Aronofsky's producing partner, Eric Watson. Eventually, Aronofsky left to focus on ""The Fountain"", and Paramount replaced him with Paul Greengrass, with a target release date of summer 2006. At this time, Simon Pegg was involved in negotiations to portray Rorschach, while Daniel Craig, Jude Law, and Sigourney Weaver were also interested in the film. Greengrass wanted Joaquin Phoenix for Dr. Manhattan. To publicize the film, Paramount launched a now-defunct ""Watchmen"" teaser website that had a message board as well as computer wallpaper available to download. Graphic artist Tristan Schane drew designs of Dr. Manhattan for the film, which depicted him with visible intestines. Gilliam read Greengrass's revision of Hayter's script and liked it, but told the director he did not think the studio would greenlight such a dark film. In March 2005, with rumors that high-profile projects, including ""Watchmen"", were in danger of being cut, Paramount's CEO Donald De Line began urging a reduction in ""Watchmen""'s budget so the film could get the greenlight. When Brad Grey took over as Paramount’s CEO, Levin feared potential budget cuts, so he made plans to move the project outside the UK in an effort to save money. Before he could, Paramount placed ""Watchmen"" in turnaround, again. In October 2005, Gordon and Levin began talks with Warner Bros., originally the second studio to be attached to ""Watchmen"", and confirmed in December 2005 that Warner Bros. had picked up the film, but that Greengrass was no longer attached to direct. In addition, the film was marked as an ""open writing assignment"", which meant David Hayter's script would be put aside. Despite this change, Hayter expressed his hope that his script would be used by Warner Bros. and that he would be attached to direct his ""dream project"". Successful development. After Warner Bros. officially became involved, the studio claimed that because Paramount had not fully reimbursed Universal for its development costs, Paramount had no legal claim over the film rights. Therefore, it would not be entitled to co-finance the film with Warner Bros. After negotiations between the studios, they agreed that Paramount would own 25% of the film and would distribute it outside North America. Impressed with Zack Snyder's work on the film ""300"", an adaptation of Frank Miller's comic book of the same name, Warner Bros. approached him to direct an adaptation of ""Watchmen"". After spending a couple of weeks deciding whether he wanted to direct the film or not, Warner Bros. officially announced Snyder’s hiring on June 23, 2006, with Alex Tse attached to write the script. Drawing from ""the best elements"" from two of Hayter’s drafts, Tse’s script returned to the original Cold War setting of the ""Watchmen"" comic. Warner Bros. was open to keeping the 1980s setting, although less so to the R-rating that Snyder wanted; Snyder also decided to add a title montage sequence to introduce the audience to the alternate history of the United States that the film presented. Snyder kept the ending from one of Hayter's drafts, which simplified details of the conspiracy within the story, because he felt it would allow more screen time to explore characters' backstories. Snyder said that he wanted the film to hold the same level of detail that was contained within the comic, with all of the easter eggs that were hidden within each frame of the comic’s panels. As such, Snyder used the comic book as his storyboard, travelling with a copy and making notes on its pages. Next to the novel, Snyder cited ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Seven"" as visual influences. To make the film more topical, Snyder emphasized the existing subplot concerning energy resources. Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman met with Snyder twice during the later stages of pre-production to further revise the script, although Snyder explained the script was merely a document for the studio, and it was his storyboards that were his true guide while making the movie. James Kakalios, author of ""The Physics of Superheroes"", was also hired as a scientific consultant. Production. Snyder hoped to have principal photography take place from June–September 2007, but filming was delayed until September 17, 2007. Snyder wanted a $150 million budget, but Warner Bros. preferred the budget remain under $100 million; the film ultimately finished with a budget of approximately $120 million. The production took place in Vancouver, where a New York City back lot was built. Sound stages were used for apartments and offices, while sequences on Mars and Antarctica were shot against green screens. Ten visual effects companies, Sony Pictures Imageworks and Intelligent Creatures among them, came on board to work on the film, which ended up having 1,100 shots featuring effects, a quarter of them being computer-generated imagery. Comic book artists Adam Hughes and John Cassaday were hired to work on character and costume designs for the film. Costume tests were being done by March 2007. ""300"" associate producer Wesley Coller portrayed Rorschach in a costume test, which Snyder inserted into a trailer that accompanied the release of ""300"". Although he intended to stay faithful to the look of the characters in the comic, Snyder wanted Nite Owl to look scarier and Ozymandias to possess authentic Egyptian attire and artifacts. Ultimately, Oyzmandias, Nite Owl and Silk Spectre changed most from the comic, as Snyder felt ""audiences might not appreciate the naiveté of the original costumes. So, there has been some effort to give them a [...] modern look—and not modern in the sense of 2007, but modern in terms of the superhero aesthetic"". Costume designer Michael Wilkinson added that the costumes had to look realistic and protective, and that the Nite Owl costume should reflect Dan's interest in aerodynamics. The chain mail in his costume resemble a bird's feathers. Snyder also wanted the costumes to ""comment directly on many of today’s modern masked vigilantes"": The Ozymandias costume, with its molded muscles and nipples, parodies the costumes in ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin"". Throughout filming, Snyder also kept adding in dialogue to mention more of the characters' backstories so the film would be as faithful as possible. Production designer Alex McDowell intended Nixon's war room to pay tribute to the war room in the film ""Dr. Strangelove"". He also wanted Dr. Manhattan's apartment, which is inside his laboratory, to look like the work of Maison Jansen, explaining that ""the powers that be, who know nothing about design, but needed to feel like he was the most important guy in America"". The apartment also echoes the film ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"", with a book prop named ""Masterpieces in Paint and Poetry"" and a tennis courtroom with similar wallpaper. Set designers selected four Kansas City sculptors' works for use on the set of Dr. Manhattan's apartment, after discovering their works on the Internet. Filming ended on February 19, 2008. Post-production. Music. Composer Tyler Bates began scoring ""Watchmen"" in November 2007. He planned to visit the shoot for a week during each month, and view assembly cuts of scenes to begin rough composing. Snyder and Bates listened to the soundtracks of 1980s films such as ""Manhunter"", ""Blade Runner"", and ""To Live and Die in L.A."" for inspiration. Bates switched between a Yamaha CS-80 or an MOTM for moments that he felt should have more ambience or synthesizers. Snyder wanted a scene where Nite Owl and Silk Spectre rescue people from a burning building to have a more traditional superhero feel, so Bates implemented a four to the floor guitar rhythm. A 64-strong choir and the 87-piece ensemble from the Hollywood Studio Symphony were hired for the more orchestral themes. The film uses some of the songs mentioned in the comic. Bates said the challenge was composing music that would transition effectively into these famous songs. One of the songs is ""The Times They Are a-Changin'"" by Bob Dylan from whom Snyder and Bates received permission to use the stems so the three-minute song could play over the six-minute opening montage. My Chemical Romance, whose members are fans of the comic, covered Dylan's ""Desolation Row"" for the first half of the closing credits. The film also features two pieces from Philip Glass' score to 1982 film ""Koyaanisqatsi"" accompanying the birth of Dr. Manhattan. Two albums, ' and ' were released on February 24, 2009 by Warner Sunset and Reprise Records. Additionally, a 12"" vinyl picture disc was released on January 27, 2009. The A-side features My Chemical Romance's cover version of ""Desolation Row"", and the B-side features ""Prison Fight"" composed by Tyler Bates for the film's score. Both songs will also be featured on the ""Music From the Motion Picture"" and ""Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"" albums, respectively. A box set consisting of seven 7"" picture disks was released on March 24, 2009. This set will also include My Chemical Romance performing ""Desolation Row"", as well as thirteen tracks from the Tyler Bates score. Editing. Snyder's first cut of the film was three hours long. In keeping the film tight, Snyder dubbed himself ""the gatekeeper"" of the comic's easter eggs, ""while studio conspire to say, 'No. Length, length, length. Playability.' [...] I've lost perspective on that now, because to me, the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody. Like, people will go, 'We've got to cut. You don't need that shot of Hollis Mason's garage sign.' And I'm like, 'What are you talking about? Of course you do. Are you crazy? How will people enjoy the movie without shit like that in it?' So it's hard for me."" Snyder cut the film down to 162 minutes when he realized there was a way to further trim the film: the murder of Hollis Mason, the first Nite Owl, which ""was easy without destroying the movie"". Moore and Gibbons' involvement. When 20th Century Fox acquired the film rights to ""Watchmen"", the comic's writer Alan Moore was initially excited about the film adaptation. In a 1987 edition of ""Comics Interview"", he revealed Sam Hamm, who was attached to write, visited him in Northampton for lunch and that he felt Hamm would provide an adaptation faithful to the comic's spirit. Ultimately, Hamm's script altered the ending, having Adrian Veidt die and Dr. Manhattan alter time so that Jon Osterman is not affected by the radiation. As a result, the remaining characters are teleported to the real world created as a result of time travel. In an interview with ""Variety""'s Danny Graydon, during Warner Bros.'s first possession of feature film rights for ""Watchmen"", Moore changed his mind, adamantly opposing a film adaptation of his comic book. Moore felt that, contrary to others’ opinion, the comic book was not cinematic. When he was approached by Terry Gilliam on how to film the comic book, Moore stated that he ""didn't think it was filmable"". Moore clarified for Graydon, ""I didn't design it to show off the similarities between cinema and comics, which ""are"" there, but in my opinion are fairly unremarkable. It was designed to show off the things that comics could do that cinema and literature couldn't."" In December 2001, Moore further explained his opposition, citing how a reader can take the time to absorb the character backgrounds, by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had just read to past elements, but that film forces you to watch the story at 24 frames per second. Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" was released, and he intends to give any resulting royalties from ""Watchmen"" to the comic's artist, Dave Gibbons. In Moore’s opinion, Hayter’s script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic, but added that he would not be going to see the film when completed. Moore said, ""My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It's been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way: in an armchair, nice and cozy next to a fire, with a steaming cup of coffee."" In November 2006, Zack Snyder said that he hoped to speak to Moore before filming, though the writer had sworn off involvement with film or television productions after his disagreement over the ""V for Vendetta"" film adaptation. Moore signed a deal to go uncredited on the film, and for his share of the income be given to Gibbons, as he had done on ""V for Vendetta"". Before filming began, Snyder said, "" totally respect his wishes to not be involved in the movie."" Moore expressed discontent over the choice of the director, saying that he ""had a lot of problems"" with the comic book ""300"" and that, while he had not seen it, he had heard that Snyder's film adaptation was racist, homophobic, and ""sublimely stupid"".  In an early interview with ""Entertainment Weekly""'s Ken Tucker, ""Watchmen"" artist Dave Gibbons said that he thought the time had passed to make a ""Watchmen"" movie. Gibbons felt that the window to make a ""Watchmen"" movie was during the success of the 1989 ""Batman"" film. When that time passed, Gibbons also told ""Neon"" magazine that he was ""[…] glad because it wouldn't have been up to the book"". Gibbons felt it would probably be better adapted as a television series like ""The Prisoner"". When given the opportunity, Gibbons enjoyed the script by Alex Tse. Gibbons gave Snyder some script advice, which the director accepted. He drew licensing art for the film, consulted on merchandise and the webcomics, publicizing the film with Snyder, and wrote a tie-in book about the creation of the comic, entitled ""Watching the Watchmen"". Moore did not mind Gibbons' involvement and felt it did not have any impact on their friendship. Snyder asked Gibbons to draw up a storyboard for the film's altered ending, which the comics' colorist John Higgins also returned to work on. Gibbons believed watching the film on DVD would emulate flipping through the book, with viewers pausing or rewinding the film to catch details. Litigation. On February 14, 2008, 20th Century Fox brought a lawsuit against Warner Bros. that alleged copyright infringement on the ""Watchmen"" film property. The studio believed it held the rights to produce the film, or at least distribute it, no matter how many studios ""Watchmen"" passed through, and sought to block its release. Warner Bros. said that Fox repeatedly failed to exercise its rights over various incarnations of the production. Through producer Lawrence Gordon, Fox had bought the rights to the comic book in 1986. Fox alleges that when it put the project into turnaround in 1994, a separate 1991 deal that transferred some of the rights to Gordon still gave them the option of distribution, sequel rights, and a share of the profits should it be made by any other studio. Fox's interpretation of the 1994 turnaround deal also meant that Gordon would not fully control the rights until the studio's development costs—estimated by Fox at $1 million—had been reimbursed. Despite originally passing on the project, Fox also alleged that its agreement with Gordon contained a ""changed elements"" clause, meaning that if Gordon changed any of the key creative personnel on the film, Fox would have first option on participation, claiming that Gordon did not inform them of Snyder's joining the production in 2005. Fox alleged that it contacted Warner Bros. before production began in 2005, and told the studio that it had violated Fox's 1991 and 1994 deals with Gordon. Warner Bros. claimed that it was originally unaware of either deal, and that in 2005 Fox had declined to produce the Hayter screenplay that formed the basis of the production. Warner Bros. also claimed that the 1994 deal did not cover distribution rights and had conferred upon Gordon all the rights he needed to take the film to Warner Bros. The studio's motion to dismiss the case in August 2008 was rejected by the judge. On December 24, 2008, Judge Gary A. Feess granted 20th Century Fox's claim to a copyright interest in the film. An attorney for 20th Century Fox said that the studio would seek an order to delay the release of ""Watchmen"". Producer Lloyd Levin revealed in an open letter that in 2005 both Fox and Warner Bros. were offered the chance to make ""Watchmen"". Fox passed on the project while Warner Bros. made a deal to acquire the movie rights and move forward with development. An internal Fox email documented that executives at Fox felt the script was ""one of the most unintelligible pieces of shit they had read in years"". On January 15, 2009, the trade press reported that Fox and Warner Bros. had reached a settlement. Fox would receive a share of the box office, but no future ownership of the film. The settlement awarded Fox up to $10 million in development costs and legal fees, plus worldwide gross participation scaling from 5 to 8.5 percent. "
wikipedia-23976653," Český Krumlov  Český Krumlov (; or ""Böhmisch Krummau""; ""Krumau""; English: Crumlaw, Bohemian Crumlaw) is a small city in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic where Český Krumlov Castle is located. Old Český Krumlov is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was given this status along with the historic Prague castle district. The city is named ""Český Krumlov"" (""Bohemian Crumlaw"") to differentiate it from ""Moravský Krumlov"" in the southeast of the country. History. Construction of the town and castle began in the late 13th century at a ford in the Vltava River, which was important in trade routes in Bohemia. In 1302 the town and castle were owned by the House of Rosenberg. Emperor Rudolf II bought Krumlov in 1602 and gave it to his natural son Julius d’Austria. Emperor Ferdinand II gave Krumlov to the House of Eggenberg. From 1719 until 1945 the castle belonged to the House of Schwarzenberg. Most of the architecture of the old town and castle dates from the 14th through 17th centuries; the town's structures are mostly in Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque styles. The core of the old town is within a horseshoe bend of the river, with the old Latrán neighborhood and castle on the other side of the Vltava. The town was seat of Duchy of Krumlov. 8,662 inhabitants lived in Krumau an der Moldau in 1910, including 7,367 Germans and 1,295 Czechs. During the interwar era it was part of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945 it was annexed by Nazi Germany as part of the Sudetenland. The town's German-speaking population were expelled after World War II and it was restored to Czechoslovakia. During the Communist era of Czechoslovakia, Krumlov fell into disrepair, but since the Velvet Revolution of 1989 much of the town's former beauty has been restored, and it is now a major holiday destination popular with tourists from Germany, Austria and beyond, as far as China. In August, 2002, the town suffered from damage in the great flood of the Vltava River. Sights. Castle. Český Krumlov Castle is unusually large for a town of Krumlov's size; within the Czech Republic it is second in extent only to the Hradčany castle complex of Prague. Inside its grounds are a large rococo garden, an extensive bridge over a deep gap in the rock upon which the castle is built, and the castle itself, which in turn consists of many defined parts dating from different periods of time. After the garden was not adequately maintained during the second half of the 20th century, the site was included in the 1996 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. With financial support from American Express the garden's central fountain was documented and reconstructed, and is functional today. Church of St. Vitus (Kostel Sv. Víta) is a Gothic church dating back to the 15th century with frescoes from the same period. Castle Theatre. Český Krumlov Castle preserves its Baroque theatre, built from 1680-82 under Prince Johann Christian I von Eggenberg and renovated with modern (at the time) stage equipment under Josef Adam zu Schwarzenberg from 1765-66. With this original stage machinery, scenery and props it is among only a few such court theatres that still exist Due to its age, the theatre is only used three times a year (only two are open to the public), when a Baroque opera is performed in simulated candlelight. The castle's last private owner was Adolph Schwarzenberg. It was here that he received President Edvard Beneš and gave him a large contribution for the defence of Czechoslovakia against the growing threat of Nazi Germany. His property was seized by the Gestapo in 1940 and then confiscated by the Czechoslovak government in 1945. Nearby. Krumlov has a museum dedicated to the painter Egon Schiele, who lived in the town. About from Krumlov is one of Bohemia's oldest monasteries, Zlatá Koruna (""The Golden Crown""). About from Krumlov is the Hluboka Castle, established in the twelfth century and later remodelled in imitation of Windsor Castle. Krumlov is close to the Šumava National Park, the Czech Republic's largest national park. The Šumava mountains lie along the border with Austria and Germany and offer a range of natural habitats - peat bogs, Alpine meadows, old-growth forests, lakes, and rivers. The area is popular with walkers, cyclists, and canoeists on the Vltava. Cesky Krumlov is only a short distance from the man-made Lake Lipno, on which many people take boat trips to various small towns on the lake and also to the Dam, which is a Hydro-electric power plant. Český Krumlov is home to Pivovar Eggenberg brewery. It has also been used as filming locations for movies such as the 2006 films ""The Illusionist"" and ""Hostel"" as well as the 1970s German movie Traumstadt (Dream City). Culture. Český Krumlov hosts a number of festivals and other events each year including the Five-Petalled Rose Festival (the name is derived from the Rožmberk crest of a 5 petal red rose), which is celebrated on the weekend of summer solstice in June. The downtown area is recreated as a medieval town with craftsmen, artists, musicians, and local people dressed in costumes from the Middle Ages. Various activities such as jousting, fencing, historical dance performances, and folk theatre take place at the castle, local park, and the river bank, among other places. The festival is concluded by a fireworks show above the castle. The International Music Festival Cesky Krumlov is one of the summer's cultural events. The Festival begins in July and ends in August, and features International music from varied musical genres. In addition, various other festivals are sprouting up throughout the year. Summer music festivals in Cesky Krumlov also include the latest blues, rock, and soul festival Open Air Krumlov, which is held annually in late June at Eggenberg Brewery Garden in Cesky Krumlov. Since the Velvet Revolution in 1989, over eighty restaurants have been established in the area. Many restaurants are located along the river and near the castle. International relations. Twin towns — Sister cities. Český Krumlov is twinned with: "

wikipedia-23956566," Irish Mercantile Marine during World War II  The Irish Mercantile Marine during World War II continued essential overseas trade during the conflict, a period referred to as The Long Watch by Irish mariners. Irish merchant shipping saw to it that vital imports continued to arrive and exports, mainly food supplies to Great Britain, were delivered. Irish ships sailed unarmed and usually alone, identifying themselves as neutrals with bright lights and by painting the Irish tricolour and EIRE in large letters on their sides and decks. Nonetheless twenty percent of seamen serving in Irish ships perished, victims of a war not their own: attacked by both sides, though predominately by the Axis powers. Often, Allied convoys could not stop to pick up survivors, while Irish ships always answered SOS signals and stopped to rescue survivors, irrespective of which side they belonged to. Irish ships rescued 534 seamen. At the outbreak of World War II, known as ""The Emergency"", Ireland declared neutrality and became isolated as never before. Shipping had been neglected since the Irish War of Independence. Foreign ships, on which Ireland's trade had hitherto depended, were less available; Neutral American ships would not enter the ""war zone"". In his Saint Patrick's Day address in 1940, Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Éamon de Valera lamented: """"No country had ever been more effectively blockaded because of the activities of belligerents and our lack of ships..."""" Ireland was a net food exporter. The excess was shipped to Britain. The Irish Mercantile Marine ensured that Irish agricultural, and other, exports reached Britain, and that British coal arrived in Ireland. Some foods such as wheat, citric fruits and tea were imported. Ireland depended on, mainly, British tankers for petroleum. Initially Irish ships sailed in British convoys. In the light of experience they choose to sail alone, relying on their neutral markings. German respect for that neutrality varied from friendly to tragic. ""Cross-channel"" trade, between Ireland and Britain, was from both national perspectives, the most important Irish trade route. Irish ships crossed the Atlantic on a route defined by the Allies: a line from Fastnet Rock to the Azores and then along the line of latitude at 38° North. Ships on the ""Lisbon-run"", imported wheat and fruits from Spain and Portugal, as well as goods transhipped from the Americas. They followed the line of longitude at 12° West, while Allied convoys to Gibraltar were 20° West. There were never more than 800 men, at any one time, serving on Irish ships during the war. There are 149 names on the Seamen's Memorial. That is a higher casualty rate than many military units. They are remembered, each year, in ceremonies in Belfast, Cork and Dublin. Background. Following independence in 1921, there was no state encouragement to develop the mercantile marine. """"Our new leaders seemed to turn their backs upon the sea and to ignore the fact that we are an island"""". Each year the fleet declined. In 1923, the merchant fleet consisted of 127 ships. This number dropped every year until 1939 when, at the start of World War II, the fleet numbered only 56 ships. Only 5% of imports were carried on Irish flagged vessels. There were several reasons for this decline: a consequence of the war of independence, a policy of self-sufficiency, the economic depression, the lack of investment and government neglect. Foreign ships, on which Ireland had hitherto depended, were withdrawn. ""In the period April 1941 and June 1942 only seven such ships visited the country"". The war of independence (1919–1921), and the civil war (1921–1922) which followed it, left the country in near economic collapse. There had been destruction of industry and infrastructure. Many industries relocated abroad. It was often cheaper to transport by sea, within Ireland, rather than using the poor road and rail networks. To take advantage of this commercial opportunity, new coasters were acquired during the 1930s, intended to ply between Irish ports. These ships would be invaluable once hostilities began. Many of these small coasters were lost, particularly on the ""Lisbon run"", a voyage for which they were never intended. Then–Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Éamon de Valera advocated a policy of self-sufficiency. International trade was discouraged. ""It was an important status symbol in the modern world for a country to produce her own goods and be self-sufficient."" The economic depression of the early 1930s had been global. It impacted upon Ireland less because of the partial recovery following the civil war and because industry was protected behind tariff barriers established during the Anglo-Irish Trade War (1932–1938). The need for extra sea capacity was readily met by British and other foreign ships. Foreign ships were used, rather than preserving the home fleet. Banks were reluctant to lend to Irish industry, preferring British government gilts. Although there was state support for many industries, this did not extend to shipping. In 1935 civil servants in de Valera's own department warned him of the consequences a war would have on the importation of fuel. He ignored that warning. Earlier, in 1926 the Ports and Harbours Tribunal was initiated. The tribunal received ""abundant evidence"" of ""inefficient, uneconomic and extravagant management"". It submitted a report in 1930 with recommendations which were not implemented until after the war. The tribunal observed ""the public generally do not, we fear, appreciate the importance of our harbours ..."". Vickers-Armstrongs liquidated their subsidiary Vickers (Ireland) Ltd. on 15 November 1938; their Dublin Dockyard had ceased operation in 1937. On 2 September 1939 the """"realisation dawned on Ireland that the country was surrounded by water and that the sea was of vital importance to her"""". Response. Seán Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and later Minister for Supplies sought to address these issues. Many infant industries were developed during the 1930s behind a protective tariff barrier. (This is the origin of the term ""Tariff Jews"", Seán Lemass from 1932 helped Jewish entrepreneurs to set up manufacturing businesses) These industries proved valuable during the war years. They reduced the need for imports, for example in 1931 over five million pairs of shoes were imported, by 1938 this had fallen to a quarter of a million pairs. Between 1931 and 1938, Gross Industrial Output rose from £55 million to £90 million; and Industrial Employment from 162,000 to 217,000. In 1933, the government established the Industrial Credit Corporation to finance industry. In 1938, Life Assurers were required to hold their reserves in Ireland, to make capital available for industry; promptly five of the six UK providers closed, lodging their business with Irish Assurance. Private enterprises established included: Grain Importers Ltd., Animal Feed Stuffs Ltd., Fuel Importers Ltd., Oil and Fats Ltd., Timber Importers Ltd., and Tea Importers Ltd. Industry was encouraged, such as the plans for Irish National Refineries Ltd. to build an oil refinery. The former Vickers repair yard in Dublin port was reopened, in 1940, by the Dublin Port and Docks Board. It repaired British and Irish ships. Semi-state enterprises were established, including Irish Shipping, in 1941. which purchased nine vessels and leased six more. War declared. At the outbreak of the Second World War Ireland declared neutrality. There were a total of 56 Irish ships at the outbreak of World War II; 15 more were purchased or leased during the conflict, and 16 were lost. Up to then most Irish-registered ships had been flying the red ensign of the United Kingdom's Merchant Navy. All were required by UK law to fly the Red Ensign, however some, such as the Wexford Steamship Company ships, had always travelled under the tricolour. With the outbreak of hostilities, choices were forced. The Irish government ordered all Irish ships to fly the tricolour. Some British ships were on the Irish register, such as the whalers which were Scottish-owned (Christian Salvesen Shipping) but Irish-registered in order to take advantage of the Irish whale quota. The six whale catchers and the two factory ships were pressed into British naval service, after their owners transferred them to the British registry. Some ships which could be described as British also choose the Tricolour. The ""Kerrymore"", which was registered as belonging to R McGowan of Tralee, was actually owned by Kelly Colliers of Belfast. Most of the crew had addresses in loyalist areas of Belfast. For six years they sailed under the tricolour. The Belfast Steamship Company's MV ""Munster"" which operated the Belfast to Liverpool route, (both British ports) flew the tricolour. But, no flag was a protection against mines; the ""Munster"" struck a mine approaching Liverpool and sank. There were over 200 passengers and 50 crew on board. A few hours later they were all rescued by the collier ""Ringwall"". Four were injured; and one died later. The L&NWR ferries ""Cambria"", ""Hibernia"" and ""Scotia"" were Irish-registered and sailed between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead, under the Red Ensign. Their British crews were taken aback when the tricolour was hoisted. They went on strike and refused to sail until the ships were transferred to the British registry and red ensign was restored. ""Scotia"" was sunk during the Dunkirk evacuation with the loss of 30 crew and 300 troops. ""Hibernia"" had a fortunate escape on the night of 20 December 1940. She was berthing at Dún Laoghaire when a German bomber ""swooped down"". All lights were extinguished. Bombs fell on the nearby Sandycove railway station. The GWR ferries operated the Rosslare to Fishguard route sailed under the red ensign. Thirty lives were lost when their ""Saint Patrick"" was bombed and sunk. The British and Irish Steam Packet Company had some of its ships on the British registry with others on the Irish registry. Cargo. Exports. The main export was agricultural produce to Britain. During the First World War, Ireland's food production increased to meet Britain's needs; a pattern which would be repeated for the Second World War. In 1916 there were under plough, this increased to in 1918, and then fell back. By the start of the trade war in 1932 tillage had fallen to . The trade war between Ireland and Britain started in 1932. During which Britain imposed a tax on Irish products. Cattle from the Irish republic were taxed but cattle from Northern Ireland were not. So, cattle were smuggled across the border. In 1934/5, about 100,000 cattle were ""exported"" in this way. The Department of Supplies was ""all in favour of the smuggling and urged that nothing should be done which might stop it"". By then, Britain was anxious to secure Irish food supplies before another world war. Survival in the looming war was the spur.  There were a series of agreements from the ""cattle-coal pact"" of 1935 to the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement of 1938 which ended the dispute, on terms favourable to Ireland. Under the ""cattle-coal pact"", the British set up a central authority for the purchase of cattle, under John Maynard Keynes. The prices set before the war were attractive. As the war progressed, open market prices rose dramatically. Cattle from Northern Ireland fetched a better price, so smuggling, as practised during the trade war resumed.  In answer to the demand for food during World War II, the area under plough increased from in 1939 to in 1944. Studies are inconclusive on how vital Irish food exports were to Britain, due to the difficulties in accounting for the effect of smuggling, the unreliability of statistics, and wartime censorship. While Ireland's food production was increasing, British food imports were falling; for example the UK imported 1,360,000 tons of food in August 1941, but only 674,000 tons in August 1942. Before and during the second world war, Ireland was a net food exporter and the Irish people enjoyed a high calorie diet. (Nonetheless the poor experienced real deprivation). Food was donated to war-refugees in Spain. The nation did need to import certain foods, such as fruits, tea and wheat. Nearly half of Ireland's wheat was imported from Canada. Domestic food production relied on imported fertilizer and imported animal feeding stuffs. In 1940, 74,000 tons of fertilizer were imported, only 7,000 tons arrived in 1941. Similarly 5 million tons of animal feed were imported in 1940, falling to one million in 1941 and negligible quantities thereafter.  Imports. Although Ireland had a surplus of food, some foods were not grown in Ireland, as the climate was unsuitable. Only small plots of wheat were cultivated. A series of orders for compulsory tillage were enacted, with the threat that those who did not put their fields to wheat would have their land confiscated. In 1939, of wheat were planted; by 1945 this had increased to . Yet, a shortfall remained and imports were required. Clashes between smugglers and Customs were commonplace. In 1940 the infamous ""Battle of Dowra"" took place on the border of Leitrim and Fermanagh. Revenue crews from Blacklion and Glenfarne intercepted over one hundred men with donkey loads of smuggled flour. Unwilling to part with their bounty, the smugglers used cudgels, boots, stones and fists in the ensuing struggle. Most of the flour was destroyed in the fray and some Revenue people were injured. Early in 1942, the Allies restricted wheat deliveries to Ireland. In return, the Irish threatened to withhold the export of Guinness beer. To the great annoyance of David Gray, the United States Ambassador to Ireland, Ireland received 30,000 tons of wheat. Gray complained of ""a waste of ""a vital necessity for what Americans regard at the best as a luxury and at worst a poison""."" There were plans to build an oil refinery in Dublin. In the event, this refinery was not completed. Nonetheless seven oil tankers were built in Bremen-Vegesack, Germany for Inver Tankers Ltd. Each long and capable of carrying 500 tons were on the Irish register. Britain asked Ireland to requisition the tankers, The reply was that it was not Irish policy to requisition vessels, instead offering to transfer them to the British register. They were transferred on the 6th, war had been declared on the 3rd.Two days after the transfer, on 11 September 1939, while still flying the Irish tricolour, the ""Inverliffey"" was sunk. In spite of Captain William Trowsdale's protestation that they were Irish, ""U-38"" said that they ""were sorry"" but they would sink ""Inverliffey"" as she was carrying petrol to England, considered contraband to the Germans. ""U-38""s next encounter with the Irish tricolour was less gallant. ""U-38"" shelled the fishing trawler ""Leukos"", all 11 crew were lost. Inver Tankers' entire fleet was lost during the war. U-boat encounters. Vizeadmiral Karl Dönitz issued a standing order to U-boats on 4 September 1940, which defined belligerent, neutral and friendly powers. Neutral included ""Ireland in particular"". The order concluded: ""Ireland forbids the navigation of her territorial waters by warships under threat of internment. That prohibition is to be strictly observed out of consideration for the proper preservation of her neutrality. Signed, Dönitz"". However those orders did not always protect Irish ships. Wolf Jeschonnek, commander of ""U-607"" was mildly reprimanded ""An understandable mistake by an eager captain"" for sinking the ""Irish Oak"". When ""U-46"" sank the ""Luimneach"" on the Lisbon run, her commander recorded in his war diary ""flying a British or Irish flag"". A supplement to Dönitz's order found after ""U-260"" was scuttled off Cork read: ""for political reasons, Irish ships and also at times Irish convoys are not to be attacked within the blockade zone if they are seen to be such. However, there is no ""special obligation"" to determine neutrality in the blockade zone."". There were many encounters with U-boats, some pleasant, others not so. On 16 March 1942 the ""Irish Willow"" was stopped by ""U-753"", which signalled ""Send master and ship's papers"". As Capt Shanks hailed from Belfast and therefore legally a British subject, this was considered unwise. Chief Officer Harry Cullen and four crew rowed to the U-boat. He said that his (39 year old) captain was too elderly for the boat. He added that it would be Saint Patrick's Day in the morning. They were treated to schnapps in the conning tower and given a bottle of cognac to bring back to the ""Irish Willow"". Later, the ""Irish Willow"" performed a dangerous rescue of 47 British sailors from the . On 20 March 1943, the German U-boat ""U-638"", commanded by Kapitänleutnant Heinrich Oskar Bernbeck stopped the ""Irish Elm"". Rough seas prevented the ""Elm""s crew from pulling their rowboat alongside the submarine to present their papers, so the interview was conducted by shouting. During the course of the conversation, the ""Elm""s Chief Officer Patrick Hennessy gave Dún Laoghaire as his home address. Bernbeck asked if ""the strike was still on in Downey's"", a pub near Dún Laoghaire harbour. (The Downey's strike started in March 1939 and lasted 14 years.) Convoys. The Irish and British authorities co-operated in the chartering of ships. They made combined purchases of wheat, maize, sugar, animal feeds and petrol. At the start of the war, Irish ships joined convoys protected by the Royal Navy. The advantages were protection and cheaper insurance. These advantages were not borne out by experience. So they chose to sail alone. The ability to insure ships, cargo, and crew has a significant impact on the profitability of shipping. Insurance of Irish ships during the 'Long Watch' was problematic. One important aspect of this was that Irish ships usually didn't travel in convoy and insurers such as Lloyd's of London charged a higher premium to insure ships not in convoy. An example of the insurance problems faced, concerns the crew of the ""City of Waterford"". When this ship joined Convoy OG 74, the lives of the crew were insured. The ship suffered a collision with the Dutch tugboat ""Thames"", and sank. The ""Waterford""s crew was rescued by HMS ""Deptford"" and then transferred to the rescue ship ""Walmer Castle"". The ""Walmer Castle"", in turn, was bombed two days later and five of the ""City of Waterford"" survivors died. When their families made life insurance claims, they were refused, because at their time of death they were not crew of the ""City of Waterford"", but passengers of ""Walmer Castle"". Later the Irish government introduced a compensation scheme for seamen lost or injured on Irish ships and Irish Shipping opened its own marine insurance subsidiary, which made a handsome profit. Two Limerick Steamship Company ships, ""Lanahrone"" and ""Clonlara"" were part of the ""nightmare convoy"" OG-71. On 19 August 1941, ""Alva"" (Scottish) was sunk by ""U-559"", 13 survivors were rescued by ""Clonlara"". Two days later ""U-564"" sank ""Clonlara"". HMS ""Champion"" rescued 13 survivors (8 from ""Clonlara"" and 5 from ""Alva""). Eight merchant ships, two naval escorts and over 400 lives were lost. The convoy retreated to neutral Portugal. This was described as """"a bitter act of surrender could ever come our way"""". In Lisbon ""Lanahrone""s crew went on strike, which was resolved with extra life-rafts and pay. The crew of the ""Irish Poplar"" were waiting in Lisbon; when the remnants of OG 71 limped in. The crew of the ""Irish Poplar"" resolved to sail home alone. While the ""City of Dublin"" brought the ""Clonlara"" survivors to Cork, ""Lanahrone"" joined convoy HG 73. Nine of the 25 ships in that convoy were lost. These experiences and the inability of the Royal Navy to protect merchant ships had a most profound effect on all Irish Ships. Ship-owners, on the advice of their masters, decided not to sail their vessels in British convoys and by the early months of 1942 the practice had ceased. Captain William Henderson of the ""Irish Elm"", returning from a transatlantic voyage reported ""circled by two German bombers, probably Condors, they circled for a considerable time and inspected closely but didn't molest. The incident had given the crew great confidence in the protection afforded by the neutral markings"". Trade routes. British routes. This ""cross-channel"" trade accounted for most of Ireland's trade. The ships ranged, in age, from ""Dundalk"" built, two years before the start of the war, in 1937 to ""Brooklands"" built in 1859. The most important vessels to Ireland were the ten colliers and to Britain the livestock carriers. Initially Germany respected the neutrality of Irish vessels, apologising for the first attack on the collier ""Kerry Head"" and paying compensation. Losses came from mines, rather than direct attacks. ""Meath"" suffered such a fate; while she was being inspected by the British Naval Control Service, she was struck by a magnetic mine, drowning seven hundred cattle, and destroying both vessels. In August 1940 Germany ""required"" Ireland to cease food exports to Britain. On 17 August 1940, Germany declared a large area around Britain to be a ""scene of warlike operations"". It was believed that attacks on Irish ships and the bombing of Campile was to reinforce that message. Lord Haw-Haw in a broadcast on German, threatened that Dundalk would be bombed if the export of cattle to Britain continued. On 24 July 1941, George's Quay, Dundalk was bombed. Nonetheless, the trade continued. The first attack, after the German ultimatum, was against the schooner ""Lock Ryan"", returning to Arklow. She was strafed and bombed by three German aircraft. Fortunately ""Lock Ryan""s cargo of china clay absorbed the blast and although badly damaged, she survived. Germany acknowledged the attack but refused to pay compensation for the damage as she was in ""the blockaded area"", ""through which the Irish had been offered free passage but on terms which were rejected"". There were many attacks on ships on the cross-channel trade. During 1940, nine Irish ships were lost. That figure may be small compared with Allied losses, but it represents a larger proportion of the small Irish fleet. There were restrictions on reporting attacks on ships. Frank Aiken, the government minister whose responsibilities included censorship, reverted this policy. His intention was to let Germany know that the Irish public know, and ""they don't like it"". There had been a British proposal for transshipment. William Warnock, the Irish chargé d'affaires in Berlin told Germany that Ireland was refusing to transship British cargoes, while protesting against the attacks on Irish ships, and other neutral ships with Irish cargoes. Deliberate attacks on cross-channel shipping ceased on 5 November 1941, when the collier ""Glencree"" was strafed. There were attacks on other routes. Mines were a constant danger. The Iberian trade. On November 1939, Roosevelt signed the Fourth Neutrality Act forbidding American ships from entering the ""war zone"", which was defined as a line drawn from Spain to Iceland. Cargoes intended for Ireland were shipped to Portugal. It was up to the Irish to fetch them from there. This route, known as the Iberian Trade or the Lisbon run. Setting sail from Ireland, the ships would carry agricultural products to the United Kingdom. There they would discharge their cargo, load up on fuel, pick up a British export (often coal), and carry it to Portugal. In Portugal, usually Lisbon, Irish ships loaded the awaiting American cargo, such as fertilizer or agricultural machinery. Sometimes the cargo was not there: it may have been delayed, or lost at sea due to the war. In this case, the Irish captains would load a ""cargo of opportunity"" and bring it back to Ireland. This might be wheat or oranges; on occasions, they even purchased their own cargo of coal.  The was fortunate to have a cargo of coal when two unidentified aircraft attacked her with cannon fire. The shells lodged in the coal, rather than piercing her hull. Britain denied involvement, but when the coal was discharged shell fragments of British manufacture were found. The attackers were de Havilland Mosquitos of the Polish squadron of the RAF. The ""Cymric"" was not so fortunate, she vanished in the same waters without a trace. The Lisbon run was undertaken by small coastal trading vessels, commonly called coasters, which were not designed for deep-sea navigation. Small, and having low freeboard (frequently around ) these ships were designed never to be out of sight of land, and to be able to make quickly to a harbour when the weather turned foul. The MV ""Kerlogue"" has become the exemplar of the Irish Mercantile Marine during the Emergency. At only and long, ""Kerlogue"" was attacked by both sides and rescued both sides. Her rescue of 168 German sailors, given her size, was dramatic. From January 1941, British authorities required Irish ships to visit a British port and obtain a ""navicert"". This visit sometimes proved fatal. It also added up to to the voyage. A ship with a ""navicert"" was given free passage through allied patrols and fuel, however they would be searched. Irish ships on the ""Lisbon run"" carried UK exports to Spain and Portugal. Atlantic routes. Some British ships traded between Ireland and Britain. Other destinations were served by Irish and other neutral ships. Philip Noel-Baker (Churchill's Parliamentary Secretary) was able to tell the British parliament that ""no United Kingdom or Allied ship has been lost while carrying a full cargo of goods either to or from Eire on an ocean voyage."" He added ""a very high proportion of imports from overseas sources into Eire, and of such exports as are sent overseas from Eire, are already carried in ships on the Eire or on a neutral register."" and ""The trade between Great Britain and Eire is of mutual benefit to both countries, and the risks to British seamen which it involves are small."" During the economic depression, the Limerick Steamship Company sold both its ocean-going ships, ""Knockfierna"" and ""Kilcredane"". They were Ireland's last ocean-going ships. At the outbreak of hostilities Ireland did not have a ship designed to cross the Atlantic. British ships were not available. American ships would only travel to Portugal. Ireland depended on other neutrals. In 1940 a succession of these ships, from Norway, Greece, Argentina, and Finland, usually carrying wheat to Ireland, were lost. Soon many of these nations were no longer neutral. Ireland had to acquire its own fleet. Irish Shipping was formed. The ""Irish Poplar"" was Irish Shipping's first ship. It was acquired in Spain after it had been abandoned by its crew. Other ships were acquired from Palestine, Panama, Jugoslavia, and Chile. The Irish government minister Frank Aiken negotiated the bareboat chartering of two oil-burning steamships from the United States Maritime Commission's reserve fleet. They were both lost to U-boats. The ""Irish Oak"" was sunk in controversial circumstances by ""U-607"". All 33 crew of the ""Irish Pine"" were lost when she was sunk by ""U-608"". Three ships were from Estonia, They were in Irish ports when Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union. Their crews refused to return to the new Estonian SSR. The ships were sold to Irish Shipping. The SS ""Cetvrti"" (Jugoslavia) was abandoned in Dingle Bay after being strafed on 1 December 1940. She was salvaged by the ""Fort Rannoch"" of the Irish Navy; she was purchased and renamed ""Irish Beech"". An Italian ship, ""Caterina Gerolimich"" had been trapped in Dublin since the outbreak of the war. After the fall of Italian Fascism she was chartered, repaired and renamed ""Irish Cedar"". When the war was over, she returned to Naples with a cargo of food, a gift from Ireland to war-ravaged Italy. The was purchased on 17 June 1941, she was 46 years old, and required extensive repairs. ""She was fit for nothing but the scrap yard."" A British yard bid for, and won, the contract to renovate her. This work was completed in November 1943. Even though the Irish government paid for her purchase and for the repairs she was requisitioned by the British Ministry of War Transport and renamed ""Empire Don"". She was returned to Irish Shipping in 1945. The Irish Shipping fleet imported, across the Atlantic: 712,000 tons of wheat, 178,000 tons of coal, 63,000 tons of phosphate (for fertilizer), 24,000 tons of tobacco, 19,000 tons of newsprint, 10,000 tons of timber and 105,000 tons of assorted other cargo. Figures from the other shipping companies have not survived. After the war. When the hostilities were over, on 16 May 1945, Éamon de Valera, in his speech to the nation said: """"To the men of our Mercantile Marine who faced all the perils of the ocean to bring us essential supplies, the nation is profoundly grateful."""" The Ringsend area of Dublin has a long maritime tradition. When housing was being redeveloped in the 1970s, some streets were named after ships which were lost: ""Breman Road"", ""Breman Grove"", ""Cymric Road"", ""Isolda Road"", ""Pine Road"", ""Leukos Road"", ""Kyleclare Road"" and ""Clonlara Road"". The """"An Bonn Seirbhise Eigeandaile"""" """"An tSeirbhis Mhuir-Tractala"""" or in English: """"Emergency Service Medal"""" """"Mercantile Marine Service"""" was awarded to all who had served six months, or longer, on an Irish registered ship during the Emergency. On 24 September 2001, a plinth and plaque, embossed with the Irish tricolour was erected to commemorate those crews lost on neutral Irish registered vessels during the period 1939-45. ""a very significant gesture by our British friends towards recognising the debt of honour owed to all shipmates irrespective of nationality who lost their lives during the Second World War."" in the National Memorial Arboretum in England. In Dublin, an annual commemoration, is held on the third Sunday of November. The Cork commemoration is held on the fourth Sunday of November in the former offices of the White Star Line. The Belfast commemoration is held on the second Sunday of May. "
wikipedia-23956599," Sticky-shed syndrome  Sticky-shed syndrome is a condition created by the deterioration of the binders in a magnetic tape, which hold the iron oxide magnetizable coating to its plastic carrier. This deterioration renders the tape unusable. Some kinds of binder are known to break down over time, due to the absorption of moisture (hydrolysis).  The symptoms of this breakdown are immediately obvious even when rewinding the tape: tearing sounds and sluggish behavior. If a tape with sticky-shed syndrome is played, the reels will make screeching or squeaking sounds, and the tape will leave dusty, rusty particles on the guides and heads. Cause. Some tapes may deteriorate because of a breakdown in the binder (the glue) that holds the oxide particles on the tape if the tape was from any of the tape manufacturers who had inadvertently used an unstable binder formulation. That binder contained polyurethane that soaks up water and causes the urethane to rise to the tape's surface. This problem became known as the 'sticky-shed syndrome'. Short strands of urethane were most commonly used in tapes - until it was discovered that middle-sized strands are better and were good at absorbing moisture. Baking the tape temporarily restores the tape by driving the water molecules from the binder so that it can be safely copied to another tape or a different format. After baking, the tape usually remains in good condition for approximately a month. If the tape re-deteriorates, it may be possible to bake the tape again. Affected stock. Most tapes affected by Sticky Shed are those that were made by Ampex such as 406/407, 456/457, 499, and consumer/audiophile grade back coated tapes such as Grand Master and 20-20+. Many tapes made by Scotch/3M are also affected and the most common offenders here are the ""pro"" tapes such as 206/207, 226/227, 808, and 986 as well as audiophile tapes such as ""Classic"" and ""Master-XS"".  Though less common, many Sony branded tapes such as PR-150, SLH, ULH, and FeCr have also been reported to suffer from Sticky Shed. Blank cassettes from the 70's-90's are unaffected because the hygroscopic binder was not used in cassette formulations. However, some cassette tape formulations do suffer from a similar problem caused by fatty acids working to the surface of the tape that can cause sticking to heads and guides and severe modulation of signals through the playback head until it is cleaned. As of 2012, no documented or proven examples of Sticky Shed from Maxell, TDK, or Quantegy are known to exist. There have been a few reports of some tape from the current manufacturers ATR and RMGI exhibiting symptoms of Sticky Shed. But these may be isolated incidents relating to prototype or single bad batches and not necessarily indicative of the overall product line integrity. Neither BASF nor 3M tape production used the unstable formulation, and their tape production rarely shows this type of coating instability although BASF LH Super SM cassettes manufactured in the mid-70s are prone to the problem. Solutions. Current solutions to sticky-shed syndrome seek to safely remove the unwanted moisture from the tape binder. Two different strategies are commonly employed: applying heat to the tape (commonly called 'baking'), and changing the environment to lower the humidity. Even though baking is widely practiced, it can be destructive to the tapes. While modification of humidity by safely controlling the environment may take significantly longer, its major benefit is that it does not irreparably damage the tape. Alternate practices have also been developed by engineers to fix affected tapes. Baking. Baking is a common practice for temporarily repairing sticky-shed syndrome. There is no standard equipment or practice for baking, so each engineer is left to create their own methods and materials. Generally, tapes are baked at low temperatures for relatively long periods of time, such as 130°F to 140°F (54 to 60 °C) for 1 to 8 hours. It is commonly thought that baking a tape will temporarily remove the moisture that has accumulated in the binder. A treated tape will reportedly function like new for a few weeks to a few months before it will reabsorb moisture and be unplayable again.  Baking cannot be used with acetate tapes. When to bake. Tape baking is a somewhat risky procedure, since there is chance of damaging the tape from the heat. However, there are some important signs that show when a tape needs baking. The typical symptom is squealing when the tape passes the playback head or other fixed parts of a tape player. The squealing is audible directly from the tape and also transmitted electronically through the output of the tape recorder. Continuous use of a squealing tape risks permanently damaging the tape, as oxide is sometimes torn off the tape. This flaking residue can be seen and can feel gummy while still on the tape's surface. There is also a risk of damage to the player. Another symptom is the tape sounding dull and distorted. In a video recording, degradation can be represented by audio-visual dropouts. Procedures. There is no clear method or procedure for tape baking. Baking between 50 and 60 degrees C (120 and 140 degrees F) for approximately eight hours is one method. Normal domestic ovens are often not used because of their instability, but they can be used. More commonly, convection ovens or food dehydrators are used. Tom Neuman, Senior Staff Engineer at Ampex, knew of one extraordinary case where “a record company constructed their oven from a cardboard box, a hair dryer and a candy thermometer.” In 2002, Eddie Ciletti, Mix Magazine’s technology columnist, confessed to building a hair-dryer-powered Easybake oven to rescue his tapes. Most experts recommend not baking reel tapes wound on plastic reels, because the plastic reels can warp and become deformed; metal reels generally hold up well. These methods most likely work because the relative humidity lowers as the temperature rises, allowing the tape to release some of its excess moisture. Problems with baking. Charles Richardson makes several claims about possible damages done to tapes during baking: It should be noted that Richardson has developed and represents a commercial process called ""Rezerex"" which may impact the veracity of his statements. A report commissioned by the National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress concurs that baking is a temporary remedy and that “more research needs to be done on alternative ways of alleviating hydrolysis for polyester tapes.” Various scholars and engineers have noted specific problems associated with high temperatures. A report for the National Endowment for the Humanities, Division of Preservation and Access notes that “lower temperatures and drier conditions lead to longer life span.” Brown, Lowry and Smith found that tapes exposed to higher temperatures and humidity suffered from a loss of adhesion. Additionally, David Luepke claims that “repeated playing presumably bakings may still result in unacceptable signal loss and deterioration.” Dr. John Van Bogart at the National Media Laboratory has recommended the process, as well as the tape manufacturer Ampex, the sound recording industry magazine, ""Mix"", the Association of Moving Image Archivists and the American Folklife Center and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting & Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress. However, The National Recording Preservation Board has put forth their desire to find a better remedy for sticky shed syndrome. It appears the roundtable meeting of March 2006 acknowledged that there is a destructive element to tape baking.” One alternative was presented in 1994. Marie O’Connell was preserving and digitizing at an archive of Radio New Zealand. She began the steady application of isopropyl alcohol to tapes with sticky shed and loss of lubricant after baking had not worked. This method appears to control friction by simultaneously keeping the tape cool and lubricated as they play. O’Connell has patented her Isopropyl Drip Machine and was the Audio Archivist at the Oral History Unit at the University of Southern Mississippi & the Chief Audio Archivist of Cups N’ Strings Studios of California. No information has been revealed about the long-term condition of the tapes once this process has taken place. Marie O'Connell is now back at Radio New Zealand Sound Archives/Nga Taonga Korero as the Analogue Tape Specialist - www.soundarchives.co.nz Environmental control. Most preservationists and engineers would agree that any loss or deterioration should be avoided. Several engineers, therefore, have sought to show that careful and deliberate environmental control can lead to the reversal of sticky-shed syndrome.  Bertram and Cuddihy argue that sticky-shed syndrome is permanently and completely reversible through environmental control, something that has not been achieved with any baking method. Through their research, they discovered that an equilibrium of hydrolysis could be maintained at 65°F (18°C) and 40% relative humidity with slight fluctuations of only 3°F (1.5°C) and 5% relative humidity. The Committee on Preservation of Historical Records promote a similar approach. They state that to attain equilibrium at a satisfactory low level of hydrolysis, tapes should be stored at 20°C (68°F) and 40% relative humidity. Charles Richardson claims that he preserves tapes by placing them in a similarly stable environment and then safely cleaning debris from both sides of the tape. Use of alcohol. Marie O’Connell uses a steady supply of isopropyl alcohol to solve the problem. She created a machine that steadily applies and wipes off the excess liquid. This process may work because the alcohol lubricates the tape as O’Connell suggests. Another possible reason it may work is that as the alcohol mixes with the water in the binder, it causes the water to evaporate more quickly. This procedure, then, would have to be repeated before each playing (much like baking) and may have potential negative effects such as chemical reactions, and removal of oxide from the backing. Conclusions. Engineers may favor baking over controlling hydrolysis environmentally because of time limitations or because they are more focused on digitizing or creating duplicates of the original and are not as interested in the preservation of the original tape. They may feel that some amount of permanent damage is acceptable if they are able to create a suitable duplicate.  Research has shown that hydrolysis is reversible within very strict temperature and humidity constraints. Further research is needed, however, to determine what levels of temperature and humidity are allowable in practice and what lengths of time are needed to adequately reverse hydrolysis. It may be that certain combinations of temperature and humidity have more or less positive results. It could be found that most institutions could successfully achieve the needed levels with common and inexpensive equipment. "
wikipedia-23956711," Return-oriented programming  Return-oriented programming (ROP) is a computer security exploit technique that allows an attacker to execute code in the presence of security defenses such as non-executable memory and code signing. An attacker gains control of the call stack to hijack program control flow and then executes carefully chosen machine instruction sequences, called ""gadgets"". Each gadget typically ends in a return instruction and is located in a subroutine within the existing program and/or shared library code. Chained together, these gadgets allow an attacker to perform arbitrary operations on a machine employing defenses that thwart simpler attacks. Background. Stack smashing attacks. Return-oriented programming is an advanced version of a stack smashing attack. Generally, these types of attacks arise when an adversary manipulates the call stack by taking advantage of a bug in the program, often a buffer overrun. In a buffer overrun, a function that does not perform proper bounds checking before storing user-provided data into memory will accept more input data than it can store properly. If the data is being written onto the stack, the excess data may overflow the space allocated to the function's variables (e.g., ""locals"" in the stack diagram to the right) and overwrite the return address. This address will later be used by the function to redirect control flow back to the caller. If it has been overwritten, control flow will be diverted to the location specified by the new return address. In a standard buffer overrun attack, the attacker would simply write attack code (the ""payload"") onto the stack and then overwrite the return address with the location of these newly written instructions. Until the late 1990s, major operating systems did not offer any protection against these attacks; Microsoft Windows provided no buffer-overrun protections until 2004. Eventually, operating systems began to combat the exploitation of buffer overflow bugs by marking the memory where data is written as non-executable, a technique known as data execution prevention. With data execution prevention enabled, the machine would refuse to execute any code located in user-writable areas of memory, preventing the attacker from placing payload on the stack and jumping to it via a return address overwrite. Hardware support for data execution prevention later became available to strengthen this protection. Return-into-library technique. The widespread implementation of data execution prevention made traditional buffer overflow vulnerabilities difficult or impossible to exploit in the manner described above. Instead, an attacker was restricted to code already in memory marked executable, such as the program code itself and any linked shared libraries. Since shared libraries, such as libc, often contain subroutines for performing system calls and other functionality potentially useful to an attacker, they are the most likely candidates for finding code to assemble an attack. In a return-into-library attack, an attacker hijacks program control flow by exploiting a buffer overrun vulnerability, exactly as discussed above. Instead of attempting to write an attack payload onto the stack, the attacker instead chooses an available library function and overwrites the return address with its entry location. Further stack locations are then overwritten, obeying applicable calling conventions, to carefully pass the proper parameters to the function so it performs functionality useful to the attacker. This technique was first presented by Solar Designer in 1997, and was later extended to unlimited chaining of function calls. Borrowed code chunks. The rise of 64-bit hardware brought with it a change to the subroutine calling convention that required that the first arguments to a function be passed in registers instead of on the stack. This meant that an attacker could no longer set up a library function call with desired arguments just by manipulating the call stack via a buffer overrun exploit. Shared library developers also began to remove or restrict library functions that performed functions particularly useful to an attacker, such as system call wrappers. As a result, return-into-library attacks became much more difficult to successfully mount. The next evolution came in the form of an attack that used chunks of library functions, instead of entire functions themselves, to exploit buffer overrun vulnerabilities on machines with defenses against simpler attacks. This technique looks for functions that contain instruction sequences that pop values from the stack into registers. Careful selection of these code sequences allows an attacker to put suitable values into the proper registers to perform a function call under the new calling convention. The rest of the attack proceeds as a return-into-library attack. Return-oriented programming attacks. Return-oriented programming builds on the borrowed code chunks approach and extends it to provide Turing complete functionality to the attacker, including loops and conditional branches. Put another way, return-oriented programming provides a fully functional ""language"" that an attacker can use to make a compromised machine perform any operation desired. Hovav Shacham published the technique in 2007 and demonstrated how all the important programming constructs can be simulated using return-oriented programming against a target application linked with the C standard library and containing an exploitable buffer overrun vulnerability. A return-oriented programming attack is superior to the other attack types discussed both in expressive power and in resistance to defensive measures. None of the counter-exploitation techniques mentioned above, including removing potentially dangerous functions from shared libraries altogether, are effective against a return-oriented programming attack. x86 Return-oriented programming. Although return-oriented programming attacks can be performed on a variety of architectures, Shacham's paper and a majority of follow-up work focuses on the Intel x86 architecture. The x86 architecture is a variable-length CISC instruction set. Return-oriented programming on the x86 takes advantage of the fact that the instruction set is very ""dense"", that is, any random sequence of bytes is likely to be interpretable as some valid set of x86 instructions. It is therefore possible to search for an opcode that alters control flow, most notably the return instruction (0xC3) and then look backwards in the binary for preceding bytes that form possibly useful instructions. These sets of instruction ""gadgets"" can then be chained by overwriting the return address, via a buffer overrun exploit, with the address of the first instruction of the first gadget. The first address of subsequent gadgets is then written successively onto the stack. At the conclusion of the first gadget, a return instruction will be executed, which will pop the address of the next gadget off the stack and jump to it. At the conclusion of that gadget, the chain continues with the third, and so on. By chaining the small instruction sequences, an attacker is able to produce arbitrary program behavior from pre-existing library code. Shacham asserts that given any sufficiently large quantity of code (including, but not limited to, the C standard library), sufficient gadgets will exist for Turing-complete functionality. An automated tool has been developed to help automate the process of locating gadgets and constructing an attack against a binary. This tool, known as ROPgadget, searches through a binary looking for potentially useful gadgets, and attempts to assemble them into an attack payload that spawns a shell to accept arbitrary commands from the attacker.  A good example of a return-oriented programming attack against a C program with a buffer overrun vulnerability, constructed with ROPgadget and demonstrated with a debugger, is available here. Return-oriented programming defenses. A number of techniques have been proposed to subvert attacks based on return-oriented programming. Most rely on randomizing the location of program and library code, so that an attacker cannot accurately predict the location of instructions that might be useful in gadgets and therefore cannot mount a successful return-oriented programming attack chain. One fairly common implementation of this technique, address space layout randomization (ASLR), loads shared libraries into a different memory location at each program load. Although widely deployed by modern operating systems, ASLR is vulnerable to information leakage attacks and other approaches to determine the address of any known library function in memory. If an attacker can successfully determine the location of one known instruction, the position of all others can be inferred and a return-oriented programming attack can be constructed. This randomization approach can be taken further by relocating all the instructions of the program separately, instead of just library locations. This requires extensive runtime support, such as a software dynamic translator, to piece the randomized instructions back together at runtime. This technique is successful at making gadgets difficult to find and utilize, but comes with significant overhead. Another approach, taken by kBouncer, modifies the operating system to track that return instructions actually divert control flow back to a location immediately following a call instruction. This prevents gadget chaining, but carries a heavy performance penalty. In addition, it is possible to effect a return-oriented programming attack without using return instructions at all, but instead via other control-flow-modifying instructions such as jumps. kBouncer is not effective against this type of modified attack.

wikipedia-23957213," Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II  The coronation of Queen Elizabeth II as monarch of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ceylon, and Pakistan took place on 2 June 1953. Elizabeth, then aged 25, ascended the thrones of these countries upon the death of her father, George VI, on 6 February 1952, and was proclaimed queen by her various privy and executive councils shortly afterwards. The coronation was delayed for more than a year because of the tradition that such a festival was inappropriate during the period of mourning that followed the death of the preceding sovereign. In the ceremony itself, Elizabeth swore an oath to uphold the laws of her nations and to govern the Church of England. Celebrations took place and a commemorative medal was issued throughout the Commonwealth realms. Preparations. For the one-day coronation ceremony, 16 months of preparation took place, with the first meeting of the Coronation Commission taking place in April 1952, under the chairmanship of the Queen's husband, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (later Prince Philip). Other committees, such as the Coronation Joint Committee and the Coronation Commission, were established and were more international in nature; high commissioners from other Commonwealth realms were members of these groups, reflecting the dual domestic and international nature of the coronation. Still, though British organisers wanted it to be otherwise, no officials from any Commonwealth realm other than the UK would participate in the event itself; the governments of those countries considered the ceremony to be a religious rite unique to Britain; as Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent said at the time: ""in my view the Coronation is the official enthronement of the Sovereign as Sovereign of the U.K... We are happy to attend and witness the Coronation of the Sovereign of the U.K. but we are not direct participants in that function."" The Coronation Commission announced in June 1952 that the coronation would take place one year later, on 2 June. Elizabeth's grandmother Queen Mary died on 24 March 1953, having stated in her will that her death should not affect the planning of the coronation, and the event went ahead as scheduled. Norman Hartnell was commissioned by the Queen to design the outfits for all the members of the Royal Family and especially the dress Elizabeth would wear at the coronation; Hartnell's design for the latter evolved through nine proposals, the final reached by his own research as well as numerous personal meetings with the Queen. What resulted was a white silk dress embroidered with the floral emblems of the countries of the Commonwealth at the time: the Tudor rose of England, the Scots thistle, the Welsh leek, Irish shamrock for Northern Ireland, the wattle of Australia, the maple leaf of Canada, the New Zealand fern, South Africa's protea, two lotus flowers for India and Ceylon, and Pakistan's wheat, cotton, and jute; unknown to the Queen at the time of the gown's delivery, though, was the unique four-leaf clover embroidered on the dress' left side, where Elizabeth's hand would touch throughout the day. Elizabeth, meanwhile, rehearsed for the upcoming day with her maids of honour, a sheet used in place of the velvet train and an arrangement of chairs standing in for the carriage. So that she could become accustomed to its feel and weight, the Queen also wore the Imperial State Crown while she went about her daily business, sporting it at her desk, at tea, and while reading the newspaper. Elizabeth took part in two full rehearsals at Westminster Abbey, on 22 and 29 May, though other sources assert that the Queen attended either ""several"" rehearsals or one. Typically, the Duchess of Norfolk stood in for the Queen at rehearsals. The event. The Coronation ceremony of Elizabeth II followed a similar pattern to the coronations of the kings and queens before her, being held in Westminster Abbey, and involving the peerage and clergy. However, for the new Queen, several parts of the ceremony were markedly different. The coronation of the Queen was the first ever to be televised (although the BBC Television Service had covered part of the procession from Westminster Abbey after her father's coronation in 1937), and was also the world's first major international event to be broadcast on television. There had been considerable debate within the British Cabinet on the subject, with Prime Minister Winston Churchill against the idea; but, Elizabeth refused her British prime minister's advice on this matter and insisted the event take place before television cameras, as well as those filming with experimental 3D technology. The event was also filmed in colour, separately from the BBC's black and white television broadcast. Millions across Britain watched the coronation live, while, to make sure Canadians could see it on the same day, RAF Canberras flew film of the ceremony across the Atlantic Ocean to be broadcast by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the first non-stop flights between the United Kingdom and the Canadian mainland. In Goose Bay, Labrador, the film was transferred to a Royal Canadian Air Force CF-100 jet fighter for the further trip to Montreal. In all, three such voyages were made as the coronation proceeded. Procession. Along a route lined with sailors, soldiers, and airmen and women from across the Commonwealth, guests and officials passed in a procession before approximately three million spectators gathered in the streets of London, some having camped overnight in their spot to ensure a view of the monarch and others having access to specially built stands and scaffolding along the route. For those not present to witness the event, more than 200 microphones were stationed along the path and in Westminster Abbey, with 750 commentators broadcasting descriptions in 39 languages; more than twenty million viewers around the world watched the coverage. Military representation from throughout the Commonwealth marched in parade prior to the Queen's arrival. The procession included foreign royalty and heads of state riding to Westminster Abbey in various carriages, so many that volunteers ranging from wealthy businessmen to rural landowners were required to fill the insufficient ranks of regular footmen. The first royal coach left Buckingham Palace and moved down The Mall, which was filled with flag-waving and cheering crowds. It was followed by the Irish State Coach carrying Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who wore the circlet of her crown bearing the Koh-i-Noor diamond. Queen Elizabeth II proceeded through London from Buckingham Palace, through Trafalgar Square, and towards the abbey in the Gold State Coach. Attached to the shoulders of her dress, the Queen wore the Robe of State, a 5.5 metre (6 yard) long, hand woven silk velvet cloak lined with Canadian ermine that required the assistance of the Queen's maids of honour—Lady Jane Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Lady Anne Coke, Lady Moyra Hamilton, Lady Mary Baillie-Hamilton, Lady Jane Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, Lady Rosemary Spencer-Churchill, and the Duchess of Devonshire—to carry. Guests. After being closed since the Queen's accession for coronation preparations, on Coronation Day, Westminster Abbey was at 6am opened to the approximately 8,000 guests invited from across the Commonwealth of Nations; more prominent individuals, such as members of the Queen's family and foreign royalty, the peers of the United Kingdom, heads of state, Members of Parliament from the Queen's various legislatures, and the like, arrived after 8:30 am. Tonga's Queen Tupou III was a guest, and was noted for her cheery demeanour even while riding in an open carriage through London in the rain. Guests seated on stools were able to purchase theirs following the ceremony, with the profits going towards the cost of the coronation. Ceremony. Preceding the Queen into Westminster Abbey was St. Edward's Crown, carried into the abbey by the Lord High Steward of England, then the Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope, who was flanked by two other peers, while the Archbishops and Bishops Assistant of the Church of England, in their copes and mitres, waited outside the Great West Door for the arrival of the Queen. When this occurred at approximately 11:00 am, Elizabeth found that the friction between her robes and the carpet caused her difficulty moving forward, and she said to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, ""get me started!"" Once going, the procession, which included the various High Commissioners of the Commonwealth carrying banners bearing the shields of the coats of arms of their respective nations, moved inside the abbey, up the central aisle and through the choir to the stage, as the choirs sang ""I was glad"", an imperial setting of Psalm 122, vv. 1–3, 6, and 7 by Sir Hubert Parry. As Elizabeth prayed at and then sat herself on the Chair of Estate to the south of the altar, the Bishops carried in the religious paraphernalia—the bible, paten, and chalice—and the peers holding the coronation regalia handed it over to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who, in turn, passed them to the Dean of Westminster, Alan Campbell Don, to be placed on the altar. After the Queen moved to stand before King Edward's Chair (Coronation Chair), she turned, following as Fisher, along with the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain (the Viscount Simonds), Lord Great Chamberlain of England (the Marquess of Cholmondeley), Lord High Constable of England (the Viscount Alanbrooke), and Earl Marshal of the United Kingdom (the Duke of Norfolk), all led by the Garter Principal King of Arms (George Bellew), asked the audience in each direction of the compass separately: ""Sirs, I here present unto you Queen Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen: wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?"" The crowd would reply ""God save Queen Elizabeth,"" every time, to each of which the Queen would curtsey in return. Seated again on the Chair of Estate, Elizabeth then took the Coronation Oath as administered by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the lengthy oath, the Queen swore to govern each of her countries according to their respective laws and customs, to mete out law and justice with mercy, to uphold Protestantism in the United Kingdom and protect the Church of England and preserve its bishops and clergy. She proceeded to the altar where she stated ""The things which I have here promised, I will perform, and keep. So help me God,"" before kissing the Bible and putting the royal sign-manual to the oath as the Bible was returned to the Dean of Westminster. From him the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, James Pitt-Watson, took the Bible and presented it to the Queen again, saying ""Our gracious Queen: to keep your Majesty ever mindful of the law and the Gospel of God as the Rule for the whole life and government of Christian Princes, we present you with this Book, the most valuable thing that this world affords. Here is Wisdom; This is the royal Law; These are the lively Oracles of God.""; Elizabeth returned the book to Pitt-Watson, who placed it back with the Dean of Westminster. The communion service was then conducted, involving prayers by both the clergy and Elizabeth, Fisher asking ""O God... Grant unto this thy servant Elizabeth, our Queen, the spirit of wisdom and government, that being devoted unto thee with her whole heart, she may so wisely govern, that in her time thy Church may be in safety, and Christian devotion may continue in peace,"" before reading various excerpts from the First Epistle of Peter, Psalms, and the Gospel of Matthew. Elizabeth was then anointed as the assembly sang ""Zadok the Priest""; the Queen's jewellery and crimson cape was removed by the Earl of Ancaster and the Mistress of the Robes, the Duchess of Devonshire, and, wearing only a simple, white linen dress also designed by Hartnell to completely cover the coronation gown, she moved to be seated in the Coronation Chair. There, Fisher, assisted by Don, made a cross on the Queen's forehead with holy oil made from the same base as that which had been used in the coronation of her father. As this segment of the ceremony was considered absolutely sacrosanct, it was concealed from the view of the television cameras by a silk canopy held above the Queen by four Knights of the Garter. When this part of the coronation was complete, and the canopy removed, Don and the Duchess of Devonshire placed on the monarch the Colobium Sindonis and Supertunica. From the altar, the Dean of Westminster passed to the Lord Great Chamberlain the spurs, which were presented to the Queen and then placed back on the altar. The Sword of State was then handed to Elizabeth, who, after a prayer was uttered by Fisher, placed it herself on the altar, and the peer who had been previously holding it took it back again after paying a sum of 100 shillings. The Queen was then invested with the Armills (bracelets), Stole Royal, Robe Royal, and the Sovereign's Orb, followed by the Queen's Ring, the Sceptre with the Cross, and the Sceptre with the Dove. With the first two items on and in her right hand and the latter in her left, Queen Elizabeth was crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury, with the crowd shouting ""God save the Queen!"" at the exact moment St. Edward's Crown touched the monarch's head. The princes and peers gathered then put on their coronets and a 21-gun salute was fired from the Tower of London. With the benediction read, Elizabeth moved to the throne and the Archbishop of Canterbury and all the Bishops offered to her their fealty, after which, while the choir sang, the peers of the United Kingdom—led by the royal peers: the Queen's husband; Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince Edward, Duke of Kent—each proceeded, in order of precedence, to pay their personal homage and allegiance to Elizabeth. When the last baron had completed this task, the assembly shouted ""God save Queen Elizabeth. Long live Queen Elizabeth. May the Queen live for ever!"" Having removed all her royal regalia, Elizabeth kneeled and took the communion, including a general confession and absolution, and, along with the audience, recited the Lord's Prayer. Now wearing the Imperial State Crown and holding the Sceptre with the Cross and the Orb, and as the gathered guests sang ""God Save the Queen"", Elizabeth left Westminster Abbey through the nave and apse, out the Great West Door, followed by members of the Royal Family, the clergy, her prime ministers, etc. Then, transported back to Buckingham Palace in the Gold State Coach, with an escort of thousands of military personnel from around the Commonwealth, the Queen appeared on the balcony of the Centre Room before a gathered crowd as a flypast went overhead. Music. Although it had been assumed by many that the Master of the Queen's Musick, Arnold Bax, would be the director of music for the coronation, it was decided that it would be better to appoint the organist and master of the choristers at the abbey, William McKie, who had been in charge of music at the royal wedding in 1947. McKie convened an advisory committee with Arnold Bax and Sir Ernest Bullock, who had directed the music for the previous coronation. When it came to choosing the music, tradition demanded that Handel's ""Zadok the Priest"" and Parry's ""I was glad"" were included amongst the anthems. Other choral works included were the 16th century ""Rejoice in the Lord alway"" and Samuel Sebastian Wesley's ""Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace"". Another tradition was that new work be commissioned from the leading composers of the day; Ralph Vaughan Williams composed a new motet ""O Taste and See"", William Walton composed a setting for the ""Te Deum"", and the Canadian composer Healy Willan wrote an anthem ""O Lord our Governor"". Four new orchestral pieces were planned; Arthur Bliss composed ""Processional""; William Walton, ""Orb and Sceptre""; and Arnold Bax, ""Coronation March"". Benjamin Britten had agreed to compose a piece, but he caught influenza and then had to deal with flooding at Aldeburgh, so nothing was forthcoming. Edward Elgar's ""Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 in D"" was played immediately before Bax's march at the end of the ceremony. An innovation, at the suggestion of Vaughan Williams, was the inclusion of a hymn that the congregation were able to participate in. This proved controversial and wasn't included in the programme until the Queen had been consulted and found to be in favour; Vaughan Williams wrote an elaborate arrangement of the traditional Scottish metrical psalm, ""Old 100th"", which included military trumpet fanfares. The choir for the coronation was a combination of the choirs of Westminster Abbey, Saint Paul's Cathedral, the Chapel Royal, and Saint George's Chapel, Windsor. The final complement of choristers comprised 182 trebles, 37 male altos, 62 tenors, and 67 basses. Together with a full orchestra, conducted by Sir Adrian Boult, the total number of musicians was 480. Celebrations, monuments, and media. All across the Queen's realms, the rest of the Commonwealth, and in other parts of the world, coronation celebrations were held. The Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal was also presented to thousands of recipients throughout the Queen's countries and, in Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK, commemorative coins were issued. Three million bronze coronation medallions were ordered by the Canadian government, struck by the Royal Canadian Mint, and distributed to schoolchildren across the country; the obverse showed Elizabeth's effigy and the reverse the royal cypher above the word ""CANADA"", all circumscribed by ""ELIZABETH II REGINA CORONATA MCMLIII"". As with the coronation of George VI, acorns shed from oaks in Windsor Great Park, around Windsor Castle, were shipped around the Commonwealth and planted in parks, school grounds, cemeteries, and private gardens to grow into what are known as ""Royal Oaks"" or ""Coronation Oaks"". In London, the Queen hosted a coronation luncheon, for which the recipe Coronation chicken was devised, and a fireworks show was mounted on Victoria Embankment. Further, street parties were mounted around the United Kingdom. The Coronation Cup football tournament was held at Hampden Park, Glasgow, in May and, two weeks before the coronation, the children's literary magazine ""Collins Magazine"" rebranded itself as ""The Young Elizabethan"". News that Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had reached the summit of Mount Everest arrived in Britain on Elizabeth's coronation day; the New Zealand, American and British media dubbed it ""a coronation gift for the new Queen"". In the United States, coronation parties were mounted, one in New York City attended by the Queen's uncle and aunt, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Military tattoos, horse races, parades, and fireworks displays were mounted in Canada. The Governor General of Canada, Vincent Massey, proclaimed the day a national holiday and presided over celebrations on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, where the Queen's coronation speech was broadcast and her personal royal standard flown from the Peace Tower. Later, a public concert was held on Parliament Hill and the Governor General hosted a ball at Rideau Hall. In Newfoundland, 90,000 boxes of candy were given to children, some getting theirs delivered by Royal Canadian Air Force drops, and in Quebec, 400,000 people turned out in Montreal, some 100,000 at Jeanne-Mance Park alone. A multicultural show was put on at Exhibition Place in Toronto, square dances and exhibitions took place in the prairie provinces, and, in Vancouver, the Chinese community performed a public lion dance. On the Korean Peninsula, Canadian soldiers serving in the Korean War acknowledged the day by firing blue, red, and white coloured smoke shells at the enemy and drank rum rations in observance. "
wikipedia-23957383," Manchester Mark 1  The Manchester Mark 1 was one of the earliest stored-program computers, developed at the Victoria University of Manchester from the Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) or ""Baby"" (operational in June 1948). It was also called the Manchester Automatic Digital Machine, or MADM. Work began in August 1948, and the first version was operational by April 1949; a program written to search for Mersenne primes ran error-free for nine hours on the night of 16/17 June 1949. The machine's successful operation was widely reported in the British press, which used the phrase ""electronic brain"" in describing it to their readers. That description provoked a reaction from the head of the University of Manchester's Department of Neurosurgery, the start of a long-running debate as to whether an electronic computer could ever be truly creative. The Mark 1 was to provide a computing resource within the university, to allow researchers to gain experience in the practical use of computers, but it very quickly also became a prototype on which the design of Ferranti's commercial version could be based. Development ceased at the end of 1949, and the machine was scrapped towards the end of 1950, replaced in February 1951 by a Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer. The computer is especially historically significant because of its pioneering inclusion of index registers, an innovation which made it easier for a program to read sequentially through an array of words in memory. Thirty-four patents resulted from the machine's development, and many of the ideas behind its design were incorporated in subsequent commercial products such as the and 702 as well as the Ferranti Mark 1. The chief designers, Frederic C. Williams and Tom Kilburn, concluded from their experiences with the Mark 1 that computers would be used more in scientific roles than in pure mathematics. In 1951 they started development work on Meg, the Mark 1's successor, which would include a floating point unit. Background. In 1936, mathematician Alan Turing published a definition of a theoretical ""universal computing machine"", a computer which held its program on tape, along with the data being worked on. Turing proved that such a machine was capable of solving any conceivable mathematical problem for which an algorithm could be written. During the 1940s, Turing and others such as Konrad Zuse developed the idea of using the computer's own memory to hold both the program and data, instead of tape, but it was mathematician John von Neumann who became widely credited with defining that stored-program computer architecture, on which the Manchester Mark 1 was based. The practical construction of a von Neumann computer depended on the availability of a suitable memory device. The University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first stored-program computer, had successfully demonstrated the practicality of the stored-program approach and of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based on a standard cathode ray tube (CRT), by running its first program in June 1948. Early electronic computers were generally programmed by being rewired, or via plugs and patch panels; there was no separate program stored in memory, as in a modern computer. It could take several days to reprogram ENIAC, for instance. Stored-program computers were also being developed by other researchers, notably the National Physical Laboratory's Pilot ACE, Cambridge University's EDSAC, and the US Army's EDVAC. The SSEM and the Mark 1 differed primarily in their use of Williams tubes as memory devices, instead of mercury delay lines. From about August 1948, the SSEM was intensively developed as a prototype for the Manchester Mark 1, initially with the aim of providing the university with a more realistic computing facility. In October 1948, UK Government Chief Scientist Ben Lockspeiser was given a demonstration of the prototype Mark 1 while on a visit to the University of Manchester. Lockspeiser was so impressed by what he saw that he immediately initiated a government contract with the local firm of Ferranti to make a commercial version of the machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. In his letter to the company, dated 26 October 1948, Lockspeiser authorised the company to ""proceed on the lines we discussed, namely, to construct an electronic calculating machine to the instructions of Professor F. C. Williams"". From that point on, development of the Mark 1 had the additional purpose of supplying Ferranti with a design on which to base their commercial machine. The government's contract with Ferranti ran for five years from November 1948, and involved an estimated £35,000 per year. Development and design. The SSEM had been designed by the team of Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill. To develop the Mark 1 they were joined by two research students, D. B. G. Edwards and G. E. Thomas; work began in earnest in August 1948. The project soon had the dual purpose of supplying Ferranti with a working design on which they could base a commercial machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, and of building a computer that would allow researchers to gain experience of how such a machine could be used in practice. The first of the two versions of the Manchester Mark 1 – known as the Intermediary Version – was operational by April 1949. However, this first version lacked features such as the instructions necessary to programmatically transfer data between the main store and its newly developed magnetic backing store, which had to be done by halting the machine and manually initiating the transfer. These missing features were incorporated in the Final Specification version, which was fully working by October 1949. The machine contained 4,050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. To increase reliability, purpose-built CRTs made by GEC were used in the machine instead of the standard devices used in the SSEM. The SSEM's 32-bit word length was increased to 40 bits. Each word could hold either one 40-bit number or two 20-bit program instructions. The main store consisted of two Williams tubes each holding an array of 32 x 40-bit words – known as a page – backed up by a magnetic drum capable of storing an additional 32 pages; the capacity was increased to 128 pages in the Final Specification version. The diameter drum, initially known as a magnetic wheel, contained a series of parallel magnetic tracks around its surface, each with its own read/write head. Each track held 2,560 bits, corresponding to 2 pages (2 x 32 x 40 bits). One revolution of the drum took 30 milliseconds, during which time both pages could be transferred to the CRT main memory, although the actual data transfer time depended on the latency, the time it took for a page to arrive under the read/write head. Writing pages to the drum took about twice as long as reading. The drum's rotational speed was synchronised to the main central processor clock, which allowed for additional drums to be added. Data was recorded onto the drum using a phase modulation technique still known today as Manchester coding. The machine's instruction set was increased from the 7 of the SSEM to 26 initially, including multiplication done in hardware. This increased to 30 instructions in the Final Specification version. Ten bits of each word were allocated to hold the instruction code. The standard instruction time was 1.8 milliseconds, but multiplication was much slower, depending on the size of the operand. The machine's most significant innovation is generally considered to be its incorporation of index registers, commonplace on modern computers. The SSEM had included two registers, implemented as Williams tubes: the accumulator (A) and the program counter (C). As A and C had already been assigned, the tube holding the two index registers, originally known as B-lines, was given the name B. The contents of the registers could be used to modify program instructions, allowing convenient iteration through an array of numbers stored in memory. The Mark 1 also had a fourth tube, (M), to hold the multiplicand and multiplier for a multiplication operation. Programming. Of the 20 bits allocated for each program instruction, 10 were used to hold the instruction code, which allowed for 1,024 (210) different instructions. The machine had 26 initially, increasing to 30 when the function codes to programmatically control the data transfer between the magnetic drum and the cathode ray tube (CRT) main store were added. On the Intermediary Version programs were input by key switches, and the output was displayed as a series of dots and dashes on a cathode ray tube known as the output device, just as on the SSEM from which the Mark 1 had been developed. However, the Final Specification machine, completed in October 1949, benefitted from the addition of a teleprinter with a 5-hole paper-tape reader and punch. Mathematician Alan Turing, who had been appointed to the nominal post of Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester in September 1948, devised a base 32 encoding scheme based on the standard ITA2 5-bit teleprinter code, which allowed programs and data to be written to and read from paper tape. The ITA2 system maps each of the possible 32 binary values that can be represented in 5 bits (25) to a single character. Thus ""10010"" represents ""D"", ""10001"" represents ""Z"", and so forth. Turing changed only a few of the standard encodings; for instance, 00000 and 01000, which mean ""no effect"" and ""linefeed"" in the teleprinter code, were represented by the characters ""/"" and ""@"" respectively. Binary zero, represented by the forward slash, was the most common character in programs and data, leading to sequences written as ""///////////////"". One early user suggested that Turing's choice of a forward slash was a subconscious choice on his part, a representation of rain seen through a dirty window, reflecting Manchester's ""famously dismal"" weather. Because the Mark 1 had a 40-bit word length, eight 5-bit teleprinter characters were required to encode each word. Thus for example the binary word: 10001 10010 10100 01001 10001 11001 01010 10110 would be represented on paper tape as ZDSLZWRF. The contents of any word in store could also be set via the teleprinter's keyboard, and output onto its printer. The machine worked internally in binary, but it was able to carry out the necessary decimal to binary and binary to decimal conversions for its input and output respectively. There was no assembly language defined for the Mark 1. Programs had to be written and submitted in binary form, encoded as eight 5-bit characters for each 40-bit word; programmers were encouraged to memorize the modified ITA2 coding scheme to make their job easier. Data was read and written from the papertape punch under program control. The Mark 1 had no system of hardware interrupts; the program continued after a read or write operation had been initiated until another input/output instruction was encountered, at which point the machine waited for the first to complete. The Mark 1 had no operating system; its only system software was a few basic routines for input and output. As in the SSEM from which it was developed, and in contrast to the established mathematical convention, the machine's storage was arranged with the least significant digits to the left; thus a one was represented in five bits as ""10000"", rather than the more conventional ""00001"". Negative numbers were represented using two's complement, as most computers still do today. In that representation, the value of the most significant bit denotes the sign of a number; positive numbers have a zero in that position and negative numbers a one. Thus the range of numbers that could be held in each 40-bit word was −239 to +239 − 1 (decimal: -549,755,813,888 to +549,755,813,887). First programs. The first realistic program to be run on the Mark 1 was a search for Mersenne primes, in early April 1949, which ran error free for nine hours on the night of 16/17 June 1949. The algorithm was specified by Max Newman, head of the Mathematics Department at the University of Manchester, and the program was written by Kilburn and Tootill. Turing later wrote an optimised version of the program, dubbed the Mersenne Express. The Manchester Mark 1 continued to do useful mathematical work until 1950, including an investigation of the Riemann hypothesis and calculations in optics. Later developments. Tootill was temporarily transferred from the University of Manchester to Ferranti in August 1949 to continue work on the Ferranti Mark 1's design, and spent four months working with the company. The Manchester Mark 1 was dismantled and scrapped towards the end of 1950, replaced a few months later by the first Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer. Between 1946 and 1949 the average size of the design team working on the Mark 1 and its predecessor, the SSEM, had been about four people. During that time 34 patents were taken out based on the team's work, either by the Ministry of Supply or by its successor, the National Research Development Corporation. In July 1949 IBM invited Williams to the United States on an all-expenses-paid trip to discuss the Mark 1's design. The company subsequently licensed several of the patented ideas developed for the machine, including the Williams tube, in the design of its own 701 and 702 computers. The most significant design legacy of the Manchester Mark 1 was perhaps its incorporation of index registers, the patent for which was taken out in the names of Williams, Kilburn, Tootill, and Newman. Kilburn and Williams concluded that computers would be used more in scientific roles than pure maths, and decided to develop a new machine that would include a floating point unit. Work began in 1951, and the resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1, and much faster for maths problems. Ferranti produced a version of Meg with the Williams tubes replaced by the more reliable core memory, marketed as the Ferranti Mercury. Cultural impact. The successful operation of the Manchester Mark 1 and its predecessor, the SSEM, was widely reported in the British press, which used the phrase ""electronic brain"" to describe the machines. Lord Louis Mountbatten had earlier introduced that term in a speech delivered to the British Institution of Radio Engineers on 31 October 1946, in which he speculated about how the primitive computers then available might evolve. The excitement surrounding the reporting in 1949 of what was the first recognisably modern computer provoked a reaction unexpected by its developers; Sir Geoffrey Jefferson, professor of neurosurgery at the University of Manchester, on being asked to deliver the Lister Oration on 9 June 1949 chose ""The Mind of Mechanical Man"" as his subject. His purpose was to ""debunk"" the Manchester project. In his address he said: ""The Times"" reported on Jefferson's speech the following day, adding that Jefferson forecast that ""the day would never dawn when the gracious rooms of the Royal Society would be converted into garages to house these new fellows"". This was interpreted as a deliberate slight to Newman, who had secured a grant from the society to continue the work of the Manchester team. In response Newman wrote a follow-up article for ""The Times"", in which he claimed that there was a close analogy between the structure of the Mark 1 and the human brain. His article included an interview with Turing, who added: "

wikipedia-23957650," Belt filter  The belt filter (sometimes called a belt filter press) is an industrial machine, used for solid/liquid separation processes, particularly the dewatering of sludges in the chemical industry, mining and water treatment. The process of filtration is primarily obtained by passing a pair of filtering cloths and belts through a system of rollers.  Operation. The feed sludge to be dewatered is introduced from a hopper between two monofilament filter cloths (supported by perforated belts) which pass through a convoluted arrangement of rollers. As the belts are fed through the rollers, water is squeezed out of the sludge. When the belts pass through the final pair of rollers in the process, the filter cloths are separated and the filter cake is scraped off into a suitable container. A belt filter is generally used in phosphatic fertiliser plants to separate the solid from slurry. It comprises washing to different zone to minimise the product losses. Belt filters use a vacuum system to minimise offgas and effluent during operations. It has applications in many other areas of industry. Improvements. The effectiveness of the operation can be increased by creating a pressure difference across the filter cloth. The filter cloth is directed though a zone where either pressure or vacuum pushes water from the filter cloths and ultimately to drain.  The sludge can be combined with a filter aid or flocculant the help the filtration process and reduce blinding of the filter cloth.  Filter cloths can be cleaned throughout the operation of the process by means of water sprays positioned on the return section of the belt.  "

In January 1833, Thomas Dalton, president of the Massachusetts General Colored Association, led a successful petition to merge with the New England Anti-Slavery Society. Separate black anti-slavery societies had already existed in Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Connecticut, and New Jersey, however, a strong feeling against the organization of separate anti-slavery societies had been emerging. Together they organized Anti-Slavery conventions and speaking programs throughout New England.  Sometime after Joshua Easton was sent as a delegate to the New England society in 1833, African Americans were granted full membership in the organization. American Anti-Slavery Society. In 1833, Garrison and Arthur Tappan expanded this society and formed the American Anti-Slavery Society.

At first the New England Anti-Slavery Society and the American Society worked together with the New England Society becoming an auxiliary in 1834.  Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. In 1835, however, the New England Society gave up its regional jurisdiction and reorganized into the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. Following the Civil War the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society took up the cause of racial equality. "
wikipedia-23958136," The Idea of Justice  The Idea of Justice is a 2009 book by Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen. The book has been described by ""The Economist"" as ""commanding summation of Mr Sen’s own work on economic reasoning and on the elements and measurement of human well-being"". Sen delivered a lecture based on the book (The Penguin Annual Lecture) in Kolkata on August 5 which was followed by a discussion with Barkha Dutt. Sen's book is principally a critique and revision of John Rawls' basic ideas in ""A Theory of Justice"". Sen was a student of Rawls and the book is dedicated to his memory. One of Sen's main arguments throughout the book is that the project of social justice should not be evaluated in binary terms, as either achieved or not. Rather, he claims that justice should be understood as existing to a matter of degree, and should correspondingly be evaluated along a continuum. Furthermore, he argues that we do not need a fully established abstract ideal of justice to evaluate the fairness of different institutions. He claims that we can meaningfully compare the level of justice in two institutions without positing an ideal, transcendental idea of justice. He names the opposite position institutional transcendentalism. Sen defends one of Rawls' most fundamental theoretical concepts: justice as fairness. Although this is a vague notion fraught with difficulties in any particular case, he nevertheless views it as one of Rawls' strongest insights while rejecting the necessity of Rawls' two principles of justice emerging from the Original position thought experiment in A ""Theory of Justice"". Sen also draws heavily on Adam Smith and his first major work ""The Theory of Moral Sentiments"", arguing that it is Smith's most important and unduly overlooked work. "

wikipedia-24102186," Seven Gates of Hell  The Seven Gates of Hell is a legend of the York, Pennsylvania area of America. Two versions of the legend exist, one involving a burnt insane asylum and the other an eccentric doctor. Both agree that there are seven gates in a wooded area of Hellam Township, Pennsylvania, and that anyone who passes through all seven goes straight to Hell. The location in question never housed an institution; the aforementioned doctor only constructed one gate, to keep out trespassers. The area still receives a number of tourists, some of whom harass local residents, causing them to call the police. Myth. There are two popular versions of the myth, with numerous variants of each. One states that a mental institution used to be located on either Toad Road or Trout Run Road, depending on the source, in Hellam Township, Pennsylvania. It was erected in a remote location so as to isolate people deemed insane from the rest of the world. One day in the 1800s, a fire broke out and, due to its remoteness, firefighters could not reach the hospital in time to save it. Many patients died in the flames, while others escaped and were soon beaten to death. The gates' role in the story is disputed. Some say that the gates were put up by the local search party to trap the remaining inmates. Others say that, completely unrelated to the asylum story, an eccentric physician who lived on the property built several gates along a path deep into the forest. Both accounts agree on only one gate being visible during the day, but the other six can be seen at night. According to the legend, no one has ever passed the fifth gate, but if they passed all seven, they would go directly to hell. Another story about the gates of hell is of a man in the 1950s who murdered his wife and children with a shot gun and impaled their corpses on the spikes of one of the gates. Before the house was torn down, bullet holes were visible in the garage door and in the wall on the side of the house where the garage door was located. Reality. In reality, there is no road called ""Toad Road"" in Hellam Township, because it was washed away by Hurricane Agnes, but there is one named Trout Run Road. There was no asylum on Trout Run Road, and the local doctor only put up one gate to keep out trespassers. A related myth states that Hellam was named after hell; this is untrue as well as it is a corruption of Hallam, after Hallamshire, England. The area purported to be the location of the seven gates is on private property and trespassers can be prosecuted. Since the late 1990s, every building on the property has been torn down and the only remaining gate is the first gate at the beginning of the path. Satanic cults are said to have previously and still do hold satanic worshiping services and sacrifices on the property. Notoriety. The Seven Gates of Hell have received a fair amount of attention. Mike Argento wrote about it in the ""York Daily Record"", and Matt Lake featured a section on the gates in his book, ""Weird Pennsylvania"". Hellam Township published a page debunking the myths. Local resident Cheryl Englar reported a number of tourists searching for the gates, some harassing her and giving her cause to call the police. "
wikipedia-24102228," White Liar  ""White Liar"" is the title of a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Miranda Lambert. It was released in August 2009 as the second single from her album ""Revolution"". Lambert performed ""White Liar"" on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" on October 6, 2009, and on the 2009 CMA Awards on November 11, 2009. In December 2009, the song became Lambert's second Top 10 hit and reached a peak of number 2 on the U.S. ""Billboard"" Hot Country Songs chart for the week of February 6, 2010. The was written by Lambert and Natalie Hemby. Lambert donated the original, handwritten copy of ""White Liar"" to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum for public display behind a glass case. Content. ""White Liar"" is a moderate up-tempo song in the key of F major backed primarily by steel guitar. The female narrator in the song describes confronting her man for cheating, whom she refers to as being a ""white liar"" for deceiving her, in reference to the term white lie. Reception. ""White Liar"" has received positive reviews from critics. Jim Malec gave the song a thumbs up, describing it as ""a decidedly alt-country track that showcases a significant Steve Earle influence and finds Lambert comfortably settling into a vocal groove that compliments the song’s melody instead of overpowering it."" He also complimented the production, which featured the ""employment of a spectacular steel track that underlines the song throughout."" Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave the song a B rating, stating that although ""the melody and production are reminiscent of Little Big Town’s best rustic country-rock, and there’s a much more commanding hook here than “Dead Flowers” had, the effort is compromised by throwaway lines. The shortage of lyrical meat gives the song an “undeveloped storyboard” kind of feel, but the overall energy of the execution goes a long way toward making up for it."" Bobby Peacock of Roughstock gave a generally favorable review as well, noting that the song ""shows a sense of growth — a sense to become even more lyrically-oriented than on even her critically acclaimed first two albums"" but adding that he considered the bridge undeveloped. ""White Liar"" received three nominations (for Single of the Year, Song of the Year, and Video of the Year) at the 2010 Academy of Country Music Awards; of these, Lambert took home the award for Video of the Year. The song was also ranked #11 on The 9513's ""Best Country Songs of 2009"" and at #35 on Roughstock's ""Top 40 Best Singles of 2009"". Music video. The music video, which was directed by Chris Hicky, made its premiere during CMT's Big New Music Weekend on October 2, 2009. The video is set at Lambert's wedding; as she walks down the aisle, she passes numerous women all of which her groom has cheated on her with. When she reaches the altar, she announces that she had been lying too, and runs off with the best man (Greg Sestero). The video features a cameo appearance of Jamey Johnson as the preacher. Lambert's parents and band members were among the wedding guests, and Lambert's long-time friend, Lacey, was the maid of honor.

wikipedia-24102338," Bay of Plenty  The Bay of Plenty is a large indentation in the northern coast of New Zealand's North Island. It stretches from the Coromandel Peninsula in the west to Cape Runaway in the east, a wide stretch of some 259 km of open coastline. The Bay of Plenty Region is situated around this body of water, also incorporating several large islands in the bay. History. The Bay of Plenty was the first part of New Zealand to be settled, by the Māori. The name ""Bay of Plenty"" originated with James Cook during his 1769–70 exploration of New Zealand, who noted the abundant resources in the area. The Māori name for the bay is ""Te Moana-a-Toi"" (""the sea of Toi""), a reference to the ancestral explorer Toi-te-huatahi. In the 1830s, Europeans began to settle in the area. On 5 October 2011, the MV Rena ran aground on the Astrolabe Reef off the coast of the Bay of Plenty causing a large oil spill. The spill is described as New Zealand's worst ever environmental disaster. Geography. The coastline from Waihi Beach in the west to Opape is defined as sandy coast, while the coast from Opape to Cape Runaway is rocky shore.  Sizeable harbours are located at Tauranga, Whakatane and Ohiwa. Major estuaries include Maketu, Little Waihi, Whakatane, Waiotahi and Waioeka/Otara. Eight major rivers empty into the bay from inland catchments, including Wairoa River, Kaituna, Tarawera, Rangitaiki, Whakatane, Waioeka, Motu and Raukokore Rivers. The bay contains numerous islands, notably the active volcano Whakaari / White Island, which lies 50 kilometres from the North Island coast in the eastern bay. Other large islands include (from west to east) Matakana Island, Mayor Island / Tuhua, Motiti Island, and Moutohora Island. Population. The coast of the bay is dotted with several sizable settlements, the largest of which is the conurbation of the city of Tauranga and its neighbour Mount Maunganui in the west. The town of Whakatane is located in the centre of the coast. Other towns of note include Waihi Beach, Katikati, Maketu, Pukehina Beach and Opotiki. The market town of Te Puke lies a short distance inland from the bay coast.  Most of the population along the bay's coast is concentrated in the western and central parts of the shore; the eastern part of the bay is sparsely populated hill country. Economy and human use. The bay is a popular area for pleasure boating and game fishing, especially in the area around the foot of the Coromandel Peninsula at the bay's western end. Tauranga is New Zealand's largest commercial port, with the Port of Tauranga handling large consignments of timber from the forested regions of the island's interior. The favourable climatic and growing conditions around the bay's coast make this area a major fruit- and vegetable-growing region, with major crops including kiwifruit and apples. There is also productive pastoral land along the coast utilised for sheep and dairy farming. Tourism. The Bay of Plenty is a popular holiday destination in New Zealand's North Island. This is owing to the warm and sunny climate during Summer and proximity to public beaches. "
wikipedia-24102615," Antonio López de Santa Anna  Antonio de Padua María Severino López de Santa Anna y Pérez de Lebrón (21 February 1794 – 21 June 1876), often known as Santa Anna or López de Santa Anna and sometimes called ""the Napoleon of the West"", was a Mexican political, general, and eleven-time president who greatly influenced early Mexican politics and government. Santa Anna fought first against Mexican independence from Spain, then in support of it. Though not the first ""caudillo"" (military leader) of Mexico, he was among the earliest.  He was general and president multiple times over a turbulent 40-year career; he was president on eleven non-consecutive occasions over a period of 22 years. A wealthy landowner, he built a firm political base in the major port city of Veracruz. He was the hero of the Army; he sought glory for himself and his army, and repeatedly rebuilt it after major losses. A brave soldier and a cunning politician, he so dominated his era that historians often call it the ""Age of Santa Anna.""  However, historians also report that he is ""perhaps the principal inhabitant even today of Mexico's black pantheon of those who failed the nation"". His centralist rhetoric and military failures resulted in Mexico losing just over half its territory, beginning with the Texas Revolution and culminating with the Mexican Cession of 1848. Early years. Santa Anna was born in Xalapa, Veracruz, Nueva España (New Spain), on 21 February 1794. He came from a respected Spanish colonial family; he and his parents, Antonio López de Santa Anna and Manuela Pérez de Lebrón, belonged to the ""criollo"" high class (""criollos"" were persons of European descent but born in the Americas). His father served for a time as a sub-delegate for the Spanish province of Veracruz. Santa Anna's parents were wealthy enough to send their son to school. In June 1810, the 16-year-old Santa Anna joined the Fijo de Veracruz infantry regiment as a cadet against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in commerce. Military career. In 1810, the same year that Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla started Mexico’s first attempt to gain independence from Spain, Santa Anna joined the colonial Spanish Army under José Joaquín de Arredondo, who taught him much about treating Mexican nationalist rebels. In 1811, Santa Anna was wounded in the ""left arm or hand"" by an arrow during the campaign under Col. Arredondo in the town of Amoladeras, in the state of San Luis Potosí. In 1813, Santa Anna served in Texas against the Gutiérrez-Magee expedition, and at the Battle of Medina, in which he was cited for bravery. He was promoted quickly; he became a second lieutenant in February 1812 and first lieutenant before the end of that year. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the young officer witnessed Arredondo's fierce counter-insurgency policy of mass executions. During the next few years, in which the war for independence reached a stalemate, Santa Anna erected villages for displaced citizens near the city of Veracruz. He also pursued gambling, a vice that would follow him all through his life. In 1816, Santa Anna was promoted to captain. He conducted occasional campaigns to suppress Native Americans or to restore order after a tumult had begun. Spanish territory extended to present-day Oregon in the north and Panama in the south. It was a territory too vast for the Spanish Crown to control. In 1821, Santa Anna declared his loyalty to ""El Libertador"" (The Liberator): the future Emperor of Mexico, Agustín de Iturbide. He rose to prominence by quickly driving Spanish forces out of the vital port city of Veracruz that same year. Iturbide rewarded him with the rank of general. Santa Anna exploited his situation for personal gain. He acquired a large hacienda and at the same time continued gambling. The era of coups. Santa Anna was ambiguous in support of Iturbide, who was never popular and needed the military to maintain his power. Santa Anna’s usual habit was to ally with the wealthy and privileged, but his immediate concern was to be on the winning side in any battle. Switching allegiances never troubled him. Santa Anna declared himself retired, ""unless my country needs me"". In 1822 Santa Anna went over to the camp of military leaders supporting the plan to overthrow Iturbide. In December 1822 Santa Anna and General Guadalupe Victoria signed the Plan de Casa Mata to abolish the monarchy and transform Mexico into a republic. In May 1823, following Iturbide's resignation, Victoria became the first president of Mexico. Santa Anna's role in the overthrow of Iturbide gained support from other leaders, although they knew of his propensity for switching sides in an opportunistic manner. By 1824, Vicente Guerrero appointed Santa Anna governor of the Mexican state of Yucatán. On his own initiative, Santa Anna prepared to invade Cuba, which remained under Spanish rule, but he possessed neither the funds nor sufficient support for such a venture. In 1828, Santa Anna, Vicente Guerrero, Lorenzo de Zavala and other politicians staged a coup against the elected President Manuel Gómez Pedraza. On 3 December 1828, the army shelled the National Palace; the election results were annulled and Guerrero took over as president. In 1829, Spain made a final attempt to retake Mexico in Tampico with an invading force of 2,600 soldiers. Santa Anna marched against the Barradas Expedition with a much smaller force and defeated the Spaniards, many of whom were suffering from yellow fever. The defeat of the Spanish army not only increased Santa Anna’s popularity but also consolidated the independence of the new Mexican republic. Santa Anna was declared a hero. From then on, he styled himself ""The Victor of Tampico"" and ""The Savior of the Motherland"". His main act of self-promotion was to call himself ""The Napoleon of the West"". In a December 1829 coup, Vice-President Anastasio Bustamante rebelled against President Guerrero, had him executed, and on 1 January 1830 took over the presidency. In 1832 a rebellion started against Bustamante, intended to install Manuel Gómez Pedraza, whose election in 1828 recognized the rebels as legitimate. The rebels offered the command to Gen. Santa Anna. In August 1832, Bustamante temporarily appointed Melchor Múzquiz to the post of president. He moved against the rebels and defeated them at Gallinero. Forces from Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, and Puebla marched to meet the forces of Santa Anna, who were approaching the town of Puebla. After two more battles, Bustamante, Pedraza, and Santa Anna signed the Agreement of Zavaleta (21–23 December 1832) to install Pedraza as president. Bustamante went into exile. Santa Anna accompanied the new president on 3 January 1833 and joined him in the capital. At the pinnacle of power. President Pedraza convened the Congress of Mexico, and it elected Santa Anna as president on 1 April 1833. President Santa Anna appointed Valentín Gómez Farías as Vice-President and largely left the governing of the nation to him. Farías began to implement liberal reforms, mostly aimed against the army and the Catholic Church, which was the state religion in Mexico. Such reforms as abolishing tithing as a legal obligation, and the seizure of church property and finances, caused concern among Mexican conservatives. In May 1834, Santa Anna ordered disarmament of the civic militia and suggested to Congress that they should abolish the controversial ""Ley del Caso"", under which the liberals' opponents had been sent into exile. The Plan of Cuernavaca, published on on 25 May 1834, called for repeal of the liberal reforms. On 12 June, Santa Anna dissolved Congress and announced his decision to adopt the Plan of Cuernavaca. Santa Anna formed a new Catholic, centralist, conservative government which replaced the 1824 constitution with the new constitutional document known as the ""Siete Leyes"" (""The Seven Laws"") of 1835. Santa Anna dissolved the Congress and began centralizing power. The regime became a dictatorship backed by the military. Several states openly rebelled against the changes: Coahuila y Tejas (the northern part of which would become the Republic of Texas), San Luis Potosí, Querétaro, Durango, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Yucatán, Jalisco, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas. Several of these states formed their own governments: the Republic of the Rio Grande, the Republic of Yucatan, and the Republic of Texas. Only the Texans defeated Santa Anna and retained their independence. Their fierce resistance was possibly fueled by reprisals Santa Anna committed against his defeated enemies. The ""New York Post"" editorialized that ""had Anna treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity, it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren"". The Zacatecan militia, the largest and best supplied of the Mexican states, led by Francisco García, was well armed with .753 caliber British 'Brown Bess' muskets and Baker .61 rifles. Nonetheless, after two hours of combat on 12 May 1835, Santa Anna's ""Army of Operations"" defeated the Zacatecan militia and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Santa Anna allowed his army to loot Zacatecas for forty-eight hours. After defeating Zacatecas, he planned to move on to Coahuila y Tejas to quell the rebellion there, which was being supported by settlers from the United States (aka ""Texians""). Texas Revolution. Like other states discontented with the central Mexican authorities, the Texas department of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas rebelled in late 1835 and declared itself independent on 2 March 1836. Santa Anna marched north to bring Texas back under Mexican control by a show of brute merciless force. His expedition posed challenges of manpower, logistics, supply, and strategy far beyond what he was prepared for, and it ended in disaster. To fund, organize and equip his army he relied, as he often did, on forcing wealthy men to provide loans. He recruited hastily, sweeping up many derelicts and ex-convicts, as well as Indians who could not understand Spanish commands. His army expected tropical weather and suffered from the cold as well as shortages of traditional foods. Stretching a supply line far longer than ever before, he lacked enough horses, mules, cattle and wagons, and thus had too little food and feed. The medical facilities were minimal. Morale sank as soldiers realized there were not enough chaplains to properly bury their bodies. Indians attacked stragglers; water sources were polluted and many men became sick. Because of his weak staff system Santa Anna was oblivious to the challenges, and was totally confident that a show of force and a few massacres (as at the Alamo and Goliad) would have the rebels begging for mercy. On 6 March 1836, at the Battle of the Alamo, Santa Anna's forces killed 189 Texan defenders and later executed more than 342 Texan prisoners including James Walker Fannin at the Goliad Massacre (27 March 1836) in a manner similar to the executions he witnessed of Mexican rebels in the 1810s as a young soldier. However, the defeat at the Alamo did serve its purpose of buying time for General Sam Houston and his Texas forces. Houston and his soldiers defeated Santa Anna's much larger army at the Battle of San Jacinto on 21 April 1836, with the Texans shouting ""Remember Goliad, Remember the Alamo!"" The day after the battle, a small Texan force led by James Sylvester captured Santa Anna. They found the general dressed in a dragoon private's uniform and hiding in a marsh. Acting Texas president David G. Burnet and Santa Anna signed the Treaties of Velasco, stating that ""in his official character as chief of the Mexican nation, he acknowledged the full, entire, and perfect Independence of the Republic of Texas."" In exchange, Burnet and the Texas government guaranteed Santa Anna's safety and transport to Veracruz. In Mexico City, however, a new government declared that Santa Anna was no longer president and that the treaty he made with Texas was null and void. While captive in Texas, Joel Roberts Poinsett — U.S. minister to Mexico in 1824 — offered a harsh assessment of General Santa Anna's situation: Santa Anna replied: Redemption, Dictatorship, and exile. After some time in exile in the United States, and after meeting with U.S. president Andrew Jackson in 1837, Santa Anna was allowed to return to Mexico aboard the USS ""Pioneer"" to retire to his hacienda in Veracruz, called ""Manga de Clavo"". In 1838, Santa Anna had a chance for redemption from the loss of Texas. After Mexico rejected French demands for financial compensation for losses suffered by French citizens, France sent forces that landed in Veracruz in the Pastry War. The Mexican government gave Santa Anna control of the army and ordered him to defend the nation by any means necessary. He engaged the French at Veracruz. During the Mexican retreat after a failed assault, Santa Anna was hit in the leg and hand by cannon fire. His shattered ankle required amputation of much of his leg, which he ordered buried with full military honors. Despite Mexico's final capitulation to French demands, Santa Anna used his war service to re-enter Mexican politics as a hero. He never allowed Mexico to forget him and his sacrifice in defending the fatherland. Santa Anna famously used a prosthetic cork leg; during the Mexican-American War, it was captured and kept by American troops. The cork leg is displayed at the Illinois State Military Museum in Springfield. The Mexican government has repeatedly asked for its return. Santa Anna had a replacement leg made which is displayed at the Museo Nacional de Historia in Mexico City. Soon after, as Anastasio Bustamante's presidency turned chaotic, supporters asked Santa Anna to take control of the provisional government. Santa Anna became president for the fifth time, taking over a nation with an empty treasury. The war with France had weakened Mexico, and the people were discontented. Also, a rebel army led by Generals José Urrea and José Antonio Mexía was marching towards the capital in opposition to Santa Anna. Commanding the army, Santa Anna crushed the rebellion in Puebla. Santa Anna's rule this time was more dictatorial than during his first administration. Anti-Santanista newspapers were banned and dissidents jailed. In 1842, he directed a military expedition into Texas, which resulted in no gain, but persuaded more Texans of the potential benefits of annexation by the more powerful United States. Santa Anna was unable to control the congressional elections of 1842. The new congress was composed of men of principles who vigorously opposed the autocratic leader. Trying to restore the treasury, Santa Anna raised taxes, but this aroused resistance. Several Mexican states stopped dealing with the central government, and Yucatán and Laredo declared themselves independent republics. With resentment growing, Santa Anna stepped down from power. Fearing for his life, he tried to elude capture, but in January 1845 he was apprehended by a group of Indians near Xico, Veracruz. They turned him over to authorities, and Santa Anna was imprisoned. His life was spared, but the dictator was exiled to Cuba. Mexican-American War. In 1846, the United States declared war on Mexico. Santa Anna wrote to Mexico City saying he had no aspirations to the presidency, but would eagerly use his military experience to fight off the foreign invasion of Mexico as he had in the past. President Valentín Gómez Farías was desperate enough to accept the offer and allowed Santa Anna to return. Meanwhile, Santa Anna had secretly been dealing with representatives of the United States, pledging that if he were allowed back in Mexico through the U.S. naval blockades, he would work to sell all contested territory to the United States at a reasonable price. Once back in Mexico at the head of an army, Santa Anna reneged on both of these agreements. Santa Anna declared himself president again and unsuccessfully tried to fight off the United States invasion. (However, his actions did inspire the sea shanty ""Santianna"".) President for the last time. In 1848, Santa Anna went into exile in Kingston, Jamaica, and two years later, moved to Turbaco, Colombia. In April 1853, he was invited back by rebellious conservatives with whom he succeeded in re-taking the government. This administration was no more successful than his earlier ones. He funneled government funds to his own pockets, sold more territory to the United States (see Gadsden Purchase), and declared himself dictator-for-life with the title ""Most Serene Highness"". The Plan of Ayutla of 1854 removed Santa Anna from power. Despite his generous payoffs to the military for loyalty, by 1855 even conservative allies had seen enough of Santa Anna. That year a group of liberals led by Benito Juárez and Ignacio Comonfort overthrew Santa Anna, and he fled back to Cuba. As the extent of his corruption became known, he was tried ""in absentia"" for treason; all his estates were confiscated by the government. Later years. Santa Anna lived in exile in Cuba, the United States, Colombia, and St. Thomas. In 1869, 74-year-old Santa Anna was living in exile in Staten Island, New York. He was trying to raise money for an army to return and take over Mexico City. During his time in New York City, he is credited with bringing in the first shipments of ""chicle"", the base of chewing gum. He failed to profit from this, since his plan was to use the chicle to replace rubber in carriage tires, which was tried without success. Thomas Adams, the American assigned to aid Santa Anna while he was in the United States, experimented with chicle in an attempt to use it as a substitute for rubber. He bought one ton of the substance from Santa Anna, but his experiments proved unsuccessful. Instead, Adams helped to found the chewing gum industry with a product that he called ""Chiclets"". Santa Anna was a passionate fan of the sport of cockfighting. He would invite breeders from all over the world for matches and is known to have spent tens of thousands of dollars on prize roosters. In 1874 he took advantage of a general amnesty and returned to Mexico. Crippled and almost blind from cataracts, he was ignored by the Mexican government at the anniversary of the Battle of Churubusco. Two years later, Santa Anna died in Mexico City on 21 June 1876 and was buried in Panteón del Tepeyac Cemetery. Personal life. Santa Anna was a devoted collector of Napoleonic artifacts, and adopted the nickname the ""Napoleon of the West"" after the ""Telegraph and Texas Register"" referred to him as such. His other nickname was ""The Eagle."" Santa Anna married Inés García in 1825 and fathered four children: Guadalupe, María del Carmen, Manuel, and Antonio. One month after García's death in 1844, the 50-year-old Santa Anna married 15-year-old María Dolores de Tosta. The couple rarely lived together, with Tosta residing primarily in Mexico City and Santa Anna's political and military activities taking him around the country. They had no children, leading biographer Will Fowler to speculate that the marriage was either primarily platonic or that Tosta was infertile. Several women claimed to have borne Santa Anna illegitimate children. In his will Santa Anna acknowledged and made provisions for four: Paula, María de la Merced, Petra, and José. Biographers have identified three more: Pedro López de Santa Anna, and Ángel and Augustina Rosa López de Santa Anna. "
wikipedia-24102656," Louis Brandeis  Louis Dembitz Brandeis (; November 13, 1856 – October 5, 1941) was an American lawyer and Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States from 1916 to 1939. He was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to Jewish immigrant parents from Bohemia, who raised him in a secular home. He enrolled at Harvard Law School, graduating at the age of twenty with the highest grade average in the law school's history. Brandeis settled in Boston where he became a recognized lawyer through his work on progressive social causes. Starting in 1890, he helped develop the ""right to privacy"" concept by writing a ""Harvard Law Review"" article of that title, and was thereby credited by legal scholar Roscoe Pound as having accomplished ""nothing less than adding a chapter to our law"". He later published a book titled ""Other People's Money And How the Bankers Use It"", suggesting ways of curbing the power of large banks and money trusts, which partly explains why he later fought against powerful corporations, monopolies, public corruption, and mass consumerism, all of which he felt were detrimental to American values and culture. He also became active in the Zionist movement, seeing it as a solution to antisemitism in Europe and Russia, while at the same time being a way to ""revive the Jewish spirit."" When his family’s finances became secure, he began devoting most of his time to public causes and was later dubbed the “People’s Lawyer.” He insisted on serving on cases without pay so that he would be free to address the wider issues involved. The ""Economist"" magazine calls him ""A Robin Hood of the law."" Among his notable early cases were actions fighting railroad monopolies; defending workplace and labor laws; helping create the Federal Reserve System; and presenting ideas for the new Federal Trade Commission (FTC). He achieved recognition by submitting a case brief, later called the ""Brandeis Brief,"" which relied on expert testimony from people in other professions to support his case, thereby setting a new precedent in evidence presentation. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson nominated Brandeis to become a member of the Supreme Court. However, his nomination was bitterly contested, partly because, as Justice William O. Douglas wrote, ""Brandeis was a militant crusader for social justice whoever his opponent might be. He was dangerous not only because of his brilliance, his arithmetic, his courage. He was dangerous because he was incorruptible. . . the fears of the Establishment were greater because Brandeis was the first Jew to be named to the Court."" He was eventually confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 47 to 22 on June 1, 1916,—21 Republican Senators and one Democratic Senator (Francis G. Newlands of Nevada) voted against his nomination—and became one of the most famous and influential figures ever to serve on the high court. His opinions were, according to legal scholars, some of the ""greatest defenses"" of freedom of speech and the right to privacy ever written by a member of the Supreme Court. Early life. Family roots. Louis Dembitz Brandeis was born on November 13, 1856, in Louisville, Kentucky, the youngest of four children. His parents, Adolph Brandeis and Frederika Dembitz, both of whom were Jewish, emigrated to the United States from their childhood homes in Prague, Bohemia (then part of the Austrian Empire). They emigrated as part of their extended families for both economic and political reasons. The Revolutions of 1848 had produced a series of political upheavals and the families, though ""liberal in their political views and sympathetic to the rebel cause,"" were ""shocked by the anti-Semitic riots that erupted in Prague while the city was in the hands of the Czech rebels."" In addition, the Habsburg Empire had imposed business taxes on Jews. Family elders sent Adolph Brandeis to America to observe and prepare for his family's possible emigration. He spent a few months in the Midwest and was impressed by the nation's institutions and by the tolerance among the people he met. He wrote home to his wife, ""America's progress is the triumph of the rights of man."" The Brandeis family chose to settle in Louisville partly because it was a prosperous river port. His earliest childhood was shaped by the American Civil War, which forced the family to seek safety temporarily in Indiana. The Brandeis family held abolitionist beliefs that angered their Louisville neighbors. Louis's father developed a grain-merchandising business. Worries about the U.S. economy took the family to Europe in 1872, but they returned in 1875. Family life. The Brandeises were considered a ""cultured family,"" trying not to discuss business or money during dinner, preferring subjects related to history, politics, and culture, or their daily experiences. Having been raised partly on German culture, Louis read and appreciated the writings of Goethe and Schiller, and his favorite composers were Beethoven and Schumann. In their religious beliefs, although his family was Jewish, only his extended family practiced a more conservative form of Judaism, while his parents practiced a more relaxed form. They celebrated the main Christian holidays along with most of their community, even treating Christmas as a secular holiday. His parents raised their children to be ""high-minded idealists,"" rather than depending solely on religion for their purpose and inspiration. In later years, his mother, Frederika, wrote of this period: According to biographer Melvin Urofsky, Brandeis was influenced greatly by his uncle Lewis Naphtali Dembitz. Unlike other members of the extended Brandeis family, Dembitz regularly practiced Judaism and was actively involved in Zionist activities. Brandeis later changed his middle name from David to Dembitz in honor of his uncle and, through his uncle's model of social activism, became an active member of the Zionist movement later in his life. Childhood education. Louis grew up in ""a family enamored with books, music, and politics, perhaps best typified by his revered uncle, Lewis Dembitz, a refined, educated man who served as a delegate to the Republican convention in 1860 that nominated Abraham Lincoln for president."" In school, Louis was a serious student in languages and other basic courses and usually achieved top scores. Brandeis graduated from the Louisville Male High School at age 14 with the highest honors. When he was sixteen, the Louisville University of the Public Schools awarded him a gold medal for ""excellence in all his studies."" Anticipating an economic downturn, Adolph Brandeis relocated the family to Europe in 1872. After a period spent traveling, Louis spent two years studying at the Annen-Realschule in Dresden, Saxony, where he excelled. He later credited his capacity for critical thinking and his desire to study law in the United States to his time there. Law school. Returning to the U.S. in 1875, Brandeis entered Harvard Law School at the age of eighteen. It was his admiration for wide learning and debating skills of his uncle, Lewis Dembitz, that inspired him to study law. Despite the fact that he entered the school without any financial help from his family, he became ""an extraordinary student"". During his time at Harvard, the teaching of law was undergoing a change of method from the traditional, memorization-reliant, ""black letter"" case law, to a more flexible and interactive Socratic method, using prior cases as the basis for discussion to instruct students in legal reasoning. Brandeis easily adapted to the new methods, soon became active in class discussions, and joined the Pow-Wow club, similar to today's moot courts in law school, which gave him experience in the role of a judge. In a letter while at Harvard, he wrote of his ""desperate longing for more law"" and of the ""almost ridiculous pleasure which the discovery or invention of a legal theory gives me."" He referred to the law as his ""mistress,"" holding a grip on him that he could not break. Unfortunately, his eyesight began failing as a result of the large volume of required reading and the poor visibility under gaslights. The school doctors suggested he give up school entirely. However, he found another alternative: paying fellow law students to read the textbooks aloud, while he tried to memorize the legal principles. Despite the difficulties, his academic work and memorization talents were so impressive that he graduated as valedictorian and achieved the highest grade point average in the history of the school, a record that stood for eight decades. Brandeis wrote of that period: ""Those years were among the happiest of my life. I worked! For me, the world's center was Cambridge."" Early career in law. After graduation, he stayed on at Harvard for another year, where he continued to study law on his own while also earning a small income by tutoring other law students. In 1878, he was admitted to the Missouri bar and accepted a job with a law firm in St. Louis, where he filed his first brief and published his first law review article. However, after seven months, he tired of the minor casework and accepted an offer by his Harvard classmate, Samuel Warren, to set up a law firm in Boston. They were close friends at Harvard where Warren ranked second in the class to Brandeis's first. Warren was also the son of a wealthy Boston family and their new firm was able to benefit from his family's connections. Soon after returning to Boston, while waiting for the law firm to gain clients, he was appointed law clerk to Horace Gray, the chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, where he worked for two years. He was admitted to the Massachusetts bar without taking an examination, which he later wrote to his brother, was ""contrary to all principle and precedent."" According to Klebanow and Jonas, ""the speed with which he was admitted probably was due to his high standing with his former professors at Harvard Law as well as to the influence of Chief Justice Gray."" First law firm: Warren and Brandeis. The new firm was eventually successful, having gained new clients from within the state and in several neighboring states as well. Their ""former professors referred a number of clients to the two fledgling lawyers,"" garnering Brandeis more financial security and the freedom to eventually take an active role in progressive causes. As partner in his law firm, he worked as a consultant and advisor to businesses, but was also as a litigator ""who reveled in the challenge of the courtroom."" In a letter to his brother, he writes, ""There is a certain joy in the exhaustion and backache of a long trial which shorter skirmishes cannot afford."" On November 6, 1889, he pleaded for the first time before the U.S. Supreme Court as the Eastern counsel of the Wisconsin Central Railroad and won. Not long after that, Chief Justice Melville Fuller recommended him to a friend as the best attorney he knew of in the Eastern U.S. Before taking on business clients, he insisted they agree to two major conditions: ""first, that he would never have to deal with intermediaries, but only with the person in charge... second, that he must be permitted to offer advice on any and all aspects of the firm's affairs"" that seemed relevant. He saw himself as a ""counselor at law,"" rather than simply a strategist in lawsuits. He preferred helping clients avoid such events as lawsuits, strikes, or other crises, by giving early advice. Brandeis explained: ""I would rather have clients than be somebody's lawyer."" In a note found among his papers, he reminded himself to ""advise client on what he should have, not what he wants."" Brandeis describes how he saw himself as an advisor: Brandeis was ""unusual among lawyers"" because he consistently turned away cases he considered bad. If he believed a client to be in the wrong, ""either he would persuade his clients to make amends ... or he would withdraw from the case."" Once, uncertain as to the rightness of his client's case, he wrote the client, ""The position that I should take if I remained in the case would be to give everybody a square deal."" Brandeis's and Warren's firm has been in continuous practice in Boston since its founding in 1879; today the firm is known as Nutter McClennen & Fish. Privacy law. Brandeis defined modern notions of the individual right to privacy in a path-breaking article he published with his partner, Warren, in the ""Harvard Law Review"" of Dec. 15, 1890, on ""The Right to Privacy."" Stimulated by anger at offensive publicity concerning the social activities of Warren's family, it adumbrated a new legal concept that has had lasting influence. Building on diverse analogies in the law of defamation, of literary property, and of eavesdropping, Brandeis argued that the central, if unarticulated, interest protected in these fields was an interest in personal integrity, ""the right to be let alone,"" that ought to be secured against invasion except for some compelling reason of public welfare. Brandeis saw emotions as a positive expression of human nature, and so desired privacy protection for them as protection against repression of the human spirit. Between 1888 and 1890, Brandeis and his law partner, Samuel Warren, wrote three scholarly articles published in the ""Harvard Law Review"". The third, ""The Right to Privacy,"" was the most important, with legal scholar Roscoe Pound saying it accomplished ""nothing less than adding a chapter to our law."" Brandeis and Warren discussed ""snapshot photography,"" a recent innovation in journalism, that allowed newspapers to publish photographs and statements of individuals without obtaining their consent. They argued that private individuals were being continually injured and that the practice weakened the ""moral standards of society as a whole."" They wrote: Legal historian Wayne McIntosh wrote that ""the privacy tort of Brandeis and Warren set the nation on a legal trajectory of such profound magnitude that it finally transcended its humble beginnings."" State courts and legislatures quickly drew on Brandeis and Warren's work. In 1905 the Georgia Supreme Court recognized a right to privacy in a case involving photographs. By 1909, California, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Utah had passed statutes establishing the right. In 1939 the American Law Institute's ""Restatement of Torts"" also recognized a right to privacy at common law. Years later, after becoming a justice on the Supreme Court, Brandeis discussed the right to privacy in his famous dissent in ""Olmstead v. United States"". Personal life and marriage. Brandeis became engaged to Alice Goldmark, of New York, in 1890. He was then thirty-four years of age and had previously found little time for courtship. Alice was the daughter of Joseph Goldmark, a physician, the brother of the composer Karl Goldmark, who had emigrated to America from Austria-Hungary after the collapse of the Revolution of 1848. They were married on March 23, 1891, at the home of her parents in New York City in a civil ceremony. The newlywed couple moved into a modest home in Boston's Beacon Hill district and had two daughters, Susan, born in 1893 and Elizabeth, 1896. Alice supported her husband's resolve to devote most of his time to public causes. The Brandeis family ""lived well but without extravagance."" With the continuing success of his law practice, they later purchased a vacation cottage in Dedham where they would spend many of their weekends and summer vacations. Unexpectedly, his wife's health soon became frail, so in addition to his professional duties he found it necessary to manage the family's domestic affairs. Brandeis as Progressive. Brandeis was a leader of the Progressive movement, using the law as the instrument for social change. His social conscience made Brandeis a leader of the Progressive Movement. From 1897 to 1916, he was in the thick of multiple reform crusades. He fought in Boston to secure honest traction franchises and in 1907 launched a six-year fight to prevent banker J. P. Morgan from monopolizing New England's railroads. After an expose of insurance fraud in 1906, he devised the Massachusetts plan to protect small wage-earners through savings bank life insurance. He supported the conservation movement and in 1910 emerged as the chief figure in the Pinchot-Ballinger investigation. Career as a public advocate. In 1889, Brandeis entered a new phase in his legal career when his partner, Samuel Warren, withdrew from their partnership to take over his recently deceased father's paper company. He then took on cases with the help of colleagues, two of whom became partners in his new firm, Brandeis, Dunbar, and Nutter, in 1897. He won his first important victory in 1891, when he persuaded the Massachusetts legislature ""to make the liquor laws less restrictive and...in his view, more reasonable and enforceable."" In arguing his case, he managed ""to devise a viable middle course."" By ""moderating"" the existing regulations, he told the lawmakers that ""they would, at a single stroke, deprive the liquor dealers of their incentive to violate the laws and to corrupt through bribery the politics of Massachusetts."" The legislature was won over by his arguments and changed the regulations. Brandeis wrote that ""the law has everywhere a tendency to lag behind the facts of life."" Therefore he planned, according to historian Steven Piott, to ""chip away at the assumption that the principles of law should be unchanging"" and ""break the traditional hold on legal thinking and work to harmonize the law with the needs of the community."" Part of his reasoning and philosophy for acting as a public advocate he later explained in his 1911 book, ""The Opportunity in the Law"": In one of his first such cases, in 1894, he represented Alice N. Lincoln, a Boston philanthropist and noted crusader for the poor. He appeared at public hearings to promote investigations into conditions in the public poor-houses. Lincoln, who had visited these poor-houses for years, ""charged that the inmates were dwelling in misery and that the temporarily unemployed were being thrown in together callously with the mentally ill and hardened criminals."" Brandeis spent nine months and held fifty-seven public hearings, at one such hearing proclaiming, ""Men are not bad. Men are degraded largely by circumstances...It is the duty of every man...to help them up and let them feel that there is some hope for them in life."" As a result of the hearings, the board of aldermen decreed that the administration of the poor law would be completely reorganized. In 1896, he was asked to lead the fight against a Boston transit company which was trying to gain concessions from the state legislature that would have given it a ""stranglehold on the city's emerging subway system."" Brandeis prevailed and the legislature enacted his bill. However, the transit franchise struggle revealed that many of Boston's politicians had placed ""friends"" and ""ward heelers"" on the payrolls of the private transit companies. Lief writes that ""One alderman alone had found work in this way for 200 of his followers. . . . in Boston, as in other American cities, such abuses were part of a larger pattern of corruption in which graft and bribery were commonplace. Convicted felons would return from prison terms to resume their political careers."". ""Always the moralist,"" writes biographer Thomas Mason, ""Brandeis declared that 'misgovernment in Boston had reached the danger point.'"" He announced that from then on he would keep a ledger of ""good and bad deeds,"" making a record of Boston's politicians accessible to all the city's voters. In one of his public addresses in 1903, he stated his goal: In 1906, Brandeis won a modest victory when the state legislature enacted a measure he drafted designed to make it a punishable crime for a public official to solicit a job from a regulated public utility or for an officer of such a company to offer such favors. He summed up his anti-corruption philosophy in his closing argument for the ""Glavis-Ballinger"" case of 1910, describing his vision of the public servant: Against monopolies. During the 1890s Brandeis began to question his views on the ""industrial order in America,"" write Klebanow and Jonas. Becoming more aware that there was a growing number of ""giant firms"" which were capable of dominating whole industries, he began to lose faith that the economic system was able to regulate them for the public's welfare. As a result, he began denouncing ""cut-throat competition"" and fretted over the dangers of monopoly. ""He became more aware of the plight of workers and more sympathetic to the labor movement."" His earlier legal battles had convinced him, according to Piott, ""that concentrated economic power could have a negative effect on a free society."" However, he also recognized the limits of trying to split up some monopolies. In an address in 1912, he said: Against big corporations. As Klebanow and Jonas make clear, Brandeis was becoming increasingly conscious of and hostile to powerful corporations and the trend toward bigness in American industry and finance. He argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added a new dimension to the Efficiency Movement of the Progressive Era. As early as 1895 he had pointed out the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans. Although the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was enacted in 1890, it was not until the 20th century that there was any major effort to apply it. In fact, by 1910 Brandeis noticed that even America's leadership, including President Theodore Roosevelt, were beginning to question the value of antitrust policies. Business experts were contending that ""there was nothing that could prevent the continuing concentration of industry and therefore, like it or not, big business was here to stay."" As a result, leaders like Roosevelt saw the need to ""regulate,"" but not limit, the growth and operation of corporate monopolies, whereas Brandeis felt the trend to bigness should be slowed, if not reversed. His experience convinced him that monopolies and trusts were ""neither inevitable nor desirable."" In support of Brandeis's position were presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and Robert M. LaFollette, senator from Wisconsin. Brandeis furthermore denied that large trusts were more efficient than the smaller firms which were generally driven out of business. He argued the opposite was often true, that monopolistic enterprises became ""less innovative"" because, he wrote, their ""secure positions freed them from the necessity which has always been the mother of invention."" To him there was no way an executive could learn all the details of running a huge and unwieldy company. ""There is a limit to what one man can do well,"" he wrote. Brandeis was naturally aware of the economies of scale and initially lower prices offered by growing companies, but he emphasized the future by claiming that once a trust drove out its competition, ""the quality of its products tended to decline while the prices charged for them tended to go up."" Eventually, he felt, the trusts would be like ""clumsy dinosaurs, which, if they ever had to face real competition, would collapse of their own weight."" In an address to the Economic Club of New York in 1912, he said: Against mass consumerism. Among Brandeis's key themes was the conflict he saw between 19th-century values with its culture of the small producer, against an emerging 20th-century age of big business and its consumerist mass society. McCraw notes that Brandeis's ""hostility to the new consumerism found vivid expression in his own behavior. Though himself a millionaire, he disliked most other wealthy persons, being profoundly disturbed by their ostentatious consumption."" He never shopped for his own clothes, preferring to reorder the same suits that served him well, nor did he own a yacht like his friends, but was satisfied with his canoe. As a result, he developed a hatred of advertising and a loss of respect for the average ""manipulated"" consumer. He recognized that a dependence by newspapers and magazines on advertising for their revenues caused them to be ""less free"" than they should be. And national advertisers further undermined the relationship between consumers and local businesses. He went so far, writes McCraw, as to ""urge journalists to 'teach the public' such lessons as 'to look with suspicion upon every advertised article.'"" But in general, Brandeis felt that consumers were becoming ""servile, self-indulgent, indolent, ignorant."" The consumer, he said, ""had abrogated his role as a countervailing power against bigness... He lies not only supine, but paralyzed, and deserves to suffer like others who take their lickings 'lying down.'"" He was repelled by the flaunting materialism overtaking America, often denouncing conspicuous consumption. But by doing so, notes McCraw, ""he drifted imperceptibly into an attack on consumer preference, a principle that lies at the very core of a market economy."" Becoming the ""People's Lawyer"". Klebanow and Jonas write that Brandeis had begun to evolve into ""the people's lawyer."" He was no longer accepting payment for ""public interest"" cases even when they required pleadings before judges, legislative committees, or administrative agencies. He also became involved in developing public opinion through writing magazine articles, making speeches, or helping form interest groups. He ""insisted on serving without pay so that he would be free to address the wider issues involved rather than confine himself merely to the case at hand."" In a 1905 address to law students and others at Harvard, he explained his philosophy: In 1910, a ""New York Times"" article tried to explain how someone of the stature of Brandeis would suddenly decide to become a public advocate: Developing new life insurance system. In March 1905, he became counsel to a New England policyholder's committee concerned that their scandal-ridden insurance company would file bankruptcy and the policyholders would lose their investments and insurance protection. He insisted on serving without pay in order to give him the freedom to address the wider issues involved. He then spent the next year studying the workings of the life insurance industry, often writing articles and giving speeches about his findings, at one point describing their practices as ""legalized robbery."" By 1906 he concluded that life insurance was ""simply a bad bargain for the vast majority of policyholders"" due mostly to the inefficiency of the industry. He also learned that the policies of ""poorly paid breadwinners"" were canceled when they missed a payment, due to little-understood clauses within the policy. As a result, he discovered that most policies lapsed, and only one out of eight original policyholders actually received benefits, leading to large insurance company profits. He succeeded in ""creating a groundswell"" in Massachusetts with his personal campaign of educating the public, and created a new ""savings bank life insurance"" system with the help of progressive businessmen, social reformers, and trade unionists. By March 1907, the Savings Bank Insurance League had 70,000 members and his ""face and name were appearing regularly in newspapers ..."" He persuaded the former governor, a Republican, to become its president, and the current governor stated in his annual message his wish for the legislature to study plans for ""cheaper insurance that may rob death of half of its terrors for the worthy poor."" Brandeis drafted his own bill, and three months later the ""savings bank insurance measure was signed into law."" He always said this bill was one of ""his greatest achievements"" and, like a proud parent, he ""kept a watchful eye on it.""  Preventing J. P. Morgan's railroad monopoly. While still involved with the life insurance industry, he took on another public interest case: the struggle to prevent New England's largest railroad company, New Haven Railroad, from gaining control of its chief competitor, the Boston and Maine Railroad. His foes were the most powerful he had ever encountered, including the region's most affluent families, Boston's legal establishment, and the large State Street bankers. Klebanow and Jonas add that ""the New Haven had been under the control of J. P. Morgan, the most powerful of all American bankers and probably the most dominating figure in all of American business."" J. P. Morgan had ""pursued a policy of expansion"" by acquiring many of the line's competitors to make the New Haven into a single unified network. Acquisitions included ""not only railways, but also trolley and shipping companies,"" writes historian John Weller. In June 1907, Brandeis was asked by Boston and Maine stockholders to present their cause to the public, a case which he again took on by insisting on serving without payment, ""leaving him free to act as he thought best."" After months of extensive research, he published a seventy-page booklet in which he argued that New Haven's acquisitions were putting its financial condition in jeopardy, and predicted that within a few years it would be forced to cut its dividends or become insolvent. He spoke in public warning Boston's citizens that the New Haven ""sought to monopolize the transportation of New England and raising the prospect of alien control."" He quickly found himself ""under attack"" by not only the New Haven, but also by many newspapers, magazines, chambers of commerce, Boston bankers, and college professors. ""I have made,"" he wrote his brother, ""more enemies than in all my previous fights together."" By 1908, however, the New Haven's proposed merger was ""dealt several stunning blows."" Among them, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that New Haven had acted illegally during earlier acquisitions. Brandeis met twice with President Theodore Roosevelt, who convinced the U.S. Department of Justice to file suit against New Haven for antitrust violations. At a subsequent hearing in front of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Boston, New Haven's president ""admitted that the railroad had maintained a floating slush fund that was used to make 'donations' to politicians who cooperated."" Within a few years, ""Haven's finances came undone just as Brandeis had predicted they would."" By the spring of 1913, the Department of Justice launched a new investigation, and the following year the Interstate Commerce Commission charged the New Haven with ""extravagance and political corruption and its board of directors with dereliction of duty."" As a result, the New Haven gave up its ""struggle for expansion"" by disposing of its Boston and Maine stock and selling off its recent acquisitions of competitors. As Mason describes it, ""after a nine-year battle against a powerful corporation ... and in the face of a long, bitter campaign of personal abuse and vilification, Brandeis and his cause again prevailed."" A newspaper in 1914 describes Brandeis as someone ""whose prophecies of disaster to the New Haven Railroad have been fully justified"". In 1934, during another confrontation with The House of Morgan, this one relating to securities regulation bills, J. P. Morgan's resident economist, Russell Leffingwell, reminded their banker, Tom Lamont, when he wrote, "". . . I think you underestimate the forces we are antagonizing. . . I believe that we are confronted with the profound politico-economic philosophy, matured in the wood for twenty years, of the finest brain and the most powerful personality in the Democratic party, who happens to be a Justice of the Supreme Court."" Banking historian Ron Chernow writes that ""For the House of Morgan, Louis Brandeis was more than just a critic, he was an adversary of almost mythical proportion."" Upholding workplace laws with the ""Brandeis Brief"". In 1908 he chose to represent the state of Oregon in the case of ""Muller v. Oregon"", to the U.S. Supreme Court. At issue was whether it was constitutional for a state law to limit the hours that female workers could work. Up until this time it was considered an ""unreasonable infringement of freedom of contract"" between employers and their employees for a state to set any wages or hours legislation. Brandeis, however, discovered that earlier Supreme Court cases limited the rights of contract when the contract had ""a real or substantial relation to public health or welfare."" He therefore decided that the best way to present the case would be to demonstrate through an abundance of workplace facts, ""a clear connection between the health and morals of female workers"" and the hours that they were required to work. To accomplish this, he filed what has become known today as the ""Brandeis Brief."" Here, he presented a much shorter traditional brief, but included more than a hundred pages of documentation, including social worker reports, medical conclusions, factory inspector observations, and other expert testimonials, which together showed a preponderance of evidence that ""when women worked long hours, it was destructive to their health and morals."" The strategy worked, and the Oregon law was upheld. Justice David Brewer directly credited Brandeis with demonstrating ""a widespread belief that woman's physical structure and the functions that she performs ... justify special legislation."" Thomas Mason writes that with the Supreme Court affirming Oregon's minimum wage law, Brandeis ""became the leading defender in the courts of protective labor legislation"" . As Justice Douglas wrote years later, ""Brandeis usually sided with the workers; he put their cause in noble words and the merits of their claims with shattering clarity."" Brandeis Brief. Widely known as ""the people's attorney,"" Brandeis pioneered pro bono work and was a true reformer. Brandeis was also the first to cite law reviews both in his briefs before the court and in his opinions as a justice. In 1907, he pioneered a new type of legal document, the ""Brandeis brief."" It included three pages of traditional legal citations and over one hundred innovative pages of citations to articles, government reports, and other references. It was packed full of social research and data to demonstrate the public interest in a ten-hour limitation on women's working hours. His brief proved decisive in Muller v. Oregon, which was the first Supreme Court ruling that accepted the legitimacy of a scientific examination of the social conditions in addition to the legal facts involved in a case. One of the hallmarks of the case was Brandeis's minimizing common-law jurisprudence in favor of extralegal information relevant to the case. According to judicial historian Stephen Powers, the ""so-called 'Brandeis Brief' became a model for progressive litigation,"" by taking into consideration social and historical realities rather than just the abstract general principles. He adds that it had ""a profound impact on the future of the legal profession"" by accepting more broad-based legal information. John Vile adds that this new ""Brandeis Brief"" was increasingly used, most notably in the ""Brown v. Board of Education"" case in 1954 that desegregated public schools. Supporting President Wilson. Brandeis's positions on regulating large corporations and monopolies carried over into the presidential campaign of 1912. Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson made it ""the central issue,"" and, according to Wilson historian Arthur Link, ""part of a larger debate over the future of the economic system and the role of the national government in American life."" Whereas the Progressive Party candidate, Theodore Roosevelt felt that trusts were inevitable and should be regulated, Wilson and his party aimed to ""destroy the trusts"" by ending special privileges, such as protective tariffs and unfair business practices that made them possible. On that basis, Brandeis, though ""nominally a Republican,"" supported Wilson and urged his friends and associates to join him. The two men met for the first time at a private conference in New Jersey that August and spent three hours discussing economic issues. Mason notes that Brandeis came away from the meeting a ""confirmed admirer of Wilson, whom he described in letters to his friends as possessed of a remarkable mind and likely to make 'an ideal president.'"" Wilson thereafter began using the term ""regulated competition,"" the concept that Brandeis had developed, and made it the essence of his program. In September, Wilson asked Brandeis to ""set forth explicitly the actual measures by which competition can be effectively regulated."" After his victory in the November election, Wilson wrote to Brandeis, ""You were yourself a great part of the victory."" Wilson considered nominating Brandeis first for Attorney General and later for Secretary of Commerce, but backed down after a loud outcry from corporate executives that he had once opposed in court battles. He concluded that Brandeis was too controversial a figure to appoint to his cabinet. Nevertheless, during Wilson's first year as president, Brandeis ""played a key role in shaping the Federal Reserve Act,"" according to banking historian Albert Link. He adds that ""Brandeis's arguments were decisive in breaking the deadlock on the banking issue."" Wilson endorsed the banking proposals of Brandeis and Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan, who, Piott points out, felt that ""the banking system needed to be democratized and its currency issued and controlled by the government,"" and convinced Congress to enact the Federal Reserve Act in December 1913. In 1913, Brandeis wrote a series of articles for ""Harper's Weekly"" that suggested ways of curbing the power of large banks and money trusts. Then in 1914 he published a book entitled ""Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It."" He also urged the Wilson administration to develop proposals for new antitrust legislation to give the Department of Justice the power to enforce antitrust laws. McCraw writes that he was ""one of the architects"" of the Federal Trade Commission and served as Wilson's chief economic adviser from 1912 until 1916. ""Above all else,"" he adds, ""Brandeis exemplified the anti-bigness ethic without which there would have been no Sherman Act, no antitrust movement, and no Federal Trade Commission."" Nominated to the Supreme Court. On January 29, 1916, Wilson ""surprised the nation"" by nominating Brandeis to become a member of the U.S. Supreme Court. However, his nomination was bitterly contested and denounced by conservative Republicans, including former president (and future Chief Justice) William Howard Taft, whose credibility was damaged by Brandeis in court battles and at one point calling him a ""muckraker."" Further opposition came from the legal profession, including former Attorney General George W. Wickersham and former presidents of the American Bar Association, such as ex-Senator and Secretary of State Elihu Root of New York, claiming he was ""unfit"" to serve on the Supreme Court. The controversy surrounding Brandeis's nomination was so great that the Senate Judiciary Committee, for the first time in its history, held a public hearing on the nomination, allowing witnesses to appear before the committee and offer testimony both in support of and in opposition to Brandeis's confirmation. While previous nominees to the Supreme Court had been confirmed or rejected by a simple up-or-down vote on the Senate floor—often on the same day on which the President had sent the nomination to the Senate—a then-unprecedented four months lapsed between Wilson's nomination of Brandeis and the Senate's final confirmation vote. ""What Brandeis's opponents most objected to,"" write Klebanow and Jonas, ""was his 'radicalism'."" The ""Wall Street Journal"" wrote, ""In all the anti-corporation agitation of the past, one name stands out ... where others were radical, he was rabid."" And the ""New York Times"" also felt that having been a noted ""reformer"" for so many years, he would lack the ""dispassionate temperament that is required of a judge."" Justice William O. Douglas, many years later, wrote that the nomination of Brandeis ""frightened the Establishment"" because he was ""a militant crusader for social justice."" According to legal historian Scot Powe, much of the opposition to Brandeis' appointment also stemmed from ""blatant anti-semitism."" Taft would accuse Brandeis of using his Judaism to curry political favor, and Wickersham would refer to Brandeis' supporters (and Taft's critics) as ""a bunch of Hebrew uplifters."" Senator Henry Cabot Lodge privately complained that ""If it were not that Brandeis is a Jew, and a German Jew, he would never have been appointed[.]"" However, those in favor of seeing him join the court were just as numerous and influential. Supporters included attorneys, social workers, and reformers with whom he had worked on cases, and ""they testified eagerly in his behalf."" Harvard law professor Roscoe Pound told the committee that ""Brandeis was one of the great lawyers,"" and predicted, writes Todd, that he would one day rank ""with the best who have sat upon the bench of the Supreme Court."" Other lawyers who supported him pointed out to the committee that he ""had angered some of his clients by his conscientious striving to be fair to both sides in a case.""  In May, when the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the Attorney General to provide the letters of endorsement that traditionally accompanied a Supreme Court nomination, Attorney General Gregory found there were none. President Wilson had made the nomination on the basis of personal knowledge. In reply to the Committee, President Wilson wrote a letter to the Chairman, Senator Culberson, testifying to his own personal estimation of the nominee's character and abilities. He called his nominee's advice ""singularly enlightening, singularly clear-sighted and judicial, and, above all, full of moral stimulation."" He added: A month later, on June 1, 1916, the Senate officially confirmed his nomination by a vote of 47 to 22. Forty four Democratic Senators and three Republicans (La Follette, Norris, and Poindexter) voted in favor of confirming Brandeis. Twenty one Republican Senators and one Democrat (Francis G. Newlands) voted against his confirmation. Leading cases. ""Gilbert v. Minnesota (1920)"" – Freedom of speech. There was a strong conservative streak in the U.S. beginning with World War I and into the 1920s, and this conservatism was reflected in decisions of the Supreme Court. However, both Brandeis and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. often dissented and became known for consistently challenging the majority's view. (However, both men approved the restrictive Schenck v. United States decision in 1919 and the pro-sterilization ""Buck v. Bell"" decision in 1927). These dissents were most noteworthy in cases dealing with the free speech rights of defendants who had expressed opposition to the military draft. Justice Holmes developed the concept of ""clear and present danger"" as the test any restriction on speech had to meet. Both Holmes and Brandeis used this doctrine in other cases. Vile points out that Brandeis was ""spurred by his appreciation for democracy, education, and the value of free speech and continued to argue vigorously for ... free speech even in wartime because of its educational value and the importance to democracy."" And according to legal historian John Raeburn Green, Brandeis's philosophy influenced Justice Holmes himself, and writes that ""Justice Holmes' conversion to a profound attachment to freedom of expression ... may be taken to have occurred in 1919, and to have coincided roughly with the advent of Mr. Justice Brandeis's influence."" One such case was ""Gilbert v. Minnesota"" (1920) which dealt with a state law prohibiting interference with the military's enlistment efforts. In his dissenting opinion, Brandeis wrote that the statute affected the ""rights, privileges, and immunities of one who is a citizen of the United States; and it deprives him of an important part of his liberty. ... statute invades the privacy and freedom of the home. Father and mother may not follow the promptings of religious belief, of conscience or of conviction, and teach son or daughter the doctrine of pacifism. If they do, any police officer may summarily arrest them."" Legal author Ken Gormley says Brandeis was ""attempting to introduce a notion of privacy which was connected in some fashion to the Constitution...and which worked in tandem with the First Amendment to assure a freedom of speech within the four brick walls of the citizen's residence."" In 1969, in ""Stanley v. Georgia"", Justice Marshall succeeded in linking the right of privacy with freedom of speech and making it part of the constitutional structure, quoting from Brandeis's ""Olmstead"" dissent and his ""Whitney"" concurrence, and adding his own conclusions from the case at hand, which dealt with the issue of viewing pornography at home: ""Whitney v. California (1927)"" – Freedom of speech. The case of ""Whitney v. California"" is notable partly because of the concurring opinion of both Justices Brandeis and Holmes. The case dealt with the prosecution of a woman for aiding the Communist Labor Party, an organization that was promoting the violent overthrow of the government. In their opinion and test to uphold the conviction, they expanded the definition of ""clear and present danger"" to include the condition that the ""evil apprehended is so imminent that it may befall before there is opportunity for full discussion."" According to legal historian Anthony Lewis, scholars have lauded Brandeis's opinion ""as perhaps the greatest defense of freedom of speech ever written by a member of the high court."" In their concurring opinion, they wrote: ""Olmstead v. United States"" (1928) – Right of privacy. In his widely cited dissenting opinion in ""Olmstead v. United States"" (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his 1890 Harvard Law Review article ""The Right to Privacy."" But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to constitutional law, going so far as saying ""the government identified ... as a potential privacy invader."" At issue in ""Olmstead"" was the use of wiretap technology to gather evidence. Referring to this ""dirty business,"" he then tried to combine the notions of civil privacy and the ""right to be left alone"" with the right offered by the Fourth Amendment which disallowed unreasonable search and seizure. Brandeis wrote in his lengthy dissent: In succeeding years his right of privacy concepts gained powerful disciples who relied on his dissenting opinion: Justice Frank Murphy, in 1942, used his ""Harvard Law Review"" article in writing an opinion for the Court; a few years later, Justice Felix Frankfurter referred to the Fourth Amendment as the ""protection of the right to be let alone,"" as in the 1947 case of ""United States v. Harris"", where his opinion wove together the speeches of James Otis, James Madison, John Adams, and Brandeis's ""Olmstead"" opinion, proclaiming the right of privacy as ""second to none in the Bill of Rights Again, five years later, Justice William O. Douglas openly declared that he had been wrong about his earlier tolerance of wiretapping and wrote, ""I now more fully appreciate the vice of the practices spawned by ""Olmstead"" ... I now feel that I was wrong ... Mr. Justice Brandeis in his dissent in ""Olmstead"" espoused the cause of privacy – the right to be let alone. What he wrote is an historic statement of that point of view. I cannot improve on it."" And in 1963, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined with these earlier opinions taking the position that ""the Brandeis point of view"" was well within the longstanding tradition of American law. However, it took the growth of surveillance technology during the 1950s and 1960s and the ""full force of the Warren Court's due process revolution,"" writes McIntosh, to finally overturn the ""Olmstead"" law: in 1967, Justice Potter Stewart wrote the opinion overturning ""Olmstead"" in ""Katz v. U.S."" McIntosh adds, ""A quarter-century after his death, another component of Justice Brandeis's privacy design was enshrined in American law."" As Wayne McIntosh notes, ""the spirit, if not the person, of Louis Brandeis, has continued to stimulate the constitutional mutation of a 'right to privacy.'"" These influences have manifested themselves in major decisions relating to everything from abortion rights to the ""right to die"" controversies. Cases dealing with a state ban on the dissemination of birth control information expanded on Brandeis by including an individual's ""body,"" not just her ""personality,"" as part of her right to privacy. In another case, Justice Harlan credited Brandeis when he wrote, ""The entire fabric of the Constitution ... guarantees that the rights to marital privacy and to marry and raise a family are of similar order and magnitude as the fundamental rights specifically protected."" And the landmark case of ""Roe v. Wade"", one of the most controversial and politically significant cases in U.S. Supreme Court history, the Court wrote, ""This right of privacy ... is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."" ""Packer Corporation v. Utah (1932)"" – Captive audience and free speech. In ""Packer Corporation v. Utah"" (1932), Brandeis was to advance an exception to the right of free speech. In this case, a unanimous Court, led by Brandeis, found a clear distinction between advertising placed in newspapers and magazines with those placed on public billboards. The case was a notable exception and dealt with a conflict between widespread First Amendment rights with the public's right of privacy and advanced a theory of the ""captive audience."" Brandeis delivered the opinion of the Court to advance privacy interests: New Deal cases. Along with Benjamin Cardozo and Harlan Fiske Stone, Brandeis was considered to be in the liberal wing of the court—the so-called Three Musketeers who stood against the conservative Four Horsemen. ""Louisville v. Radford"" (1935) – limiting presidential discretion. According to John Vile, in the final years of his career, like the rest of the Court, he ""initially combated the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, which went against everything Brandeis had ever preached in opposition to the concepts of 'bigness' and 'centralization' in the federal government and the need to return to the states."" In one case, ""Louisville v. Radford"" (1935), he spoke for a unanimous court when he declared the Frazier-Lemke Act unconstitutional. The act prevented mortgage-holding banks from foreclosing on their property for five years and forced struggling farmers to continue paying based on a court-ordered schedule. ""The Fifth Amendment,"" he declared, ""commands that however great the Nation's need, private property shall not be thus taken over without just compensation."" ""Schechter Brothers v. The United States (1935)"" – NIRA is unconstitutional. In ""Schechter Brothers v. The United States"" (1935), the Court also voted unanimously to declare the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) unconstitutional on the grounds that it gave the president ""unfettered discretion"" to make whatever laws he thought were needed for economic recovery. Economics author John Steele Gordon writes that the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was ""the first iteration of Roosevelt's New Deal ... essentially a government-run cartel to fix prices and divide markets ... This was the most radical shift in the relation between government and the private economy in American history."" Speaking to aides of Roosevelt, Justice Louis Brandeis remarked that, “This is the end of this business of centralization, and I want you to go back and tell the president that we're not going to let this government centralize everything."" Brandeis also opposed Roosevelt's court-packing scheme of 1937, which proposed to add one additional justice to the Supreme Court for every sitting member who had reached the age of seventy without retiring. ""This was,"" felt Brandeis and others on the Court, a ""thinly veiled attempt to change the decisions of the Court by adding new members who were supporters of the New Deal,"" leading historian Nelson Dawson to conclude that ""Brandeis . . . was not alone in thinking that Roosevelt's scheme threatened the integrity of the institution."" ""Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins"" (1938) – Federal versus state laws. His last important judicial opinion was also one of the most significant of his career, according to Klebanow and Jonas. In Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938), the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether federal judges apply state law or federal ""general law"" where the parties to a lawsuit are from different states. Writing for the Court, Brandeis overruled the ninety-six-year-old doctrine of ""Swift v. Tyson"" (1842), and held that there was no such thing as a ""federal general common law"" in cases involving diversity jurisdiction. This concept became known as the ""Erie"" Doctrine. Applying the Erie Doctrine, federal courts now must conduct a choice of law analysis, which generally requires that the courts apply the law of the state where the injury or transaction occurred. ""This ruling,"" concluded Klebanow and Jonas, ""fits in well with Brandeis's goals of strengthening the states and reversing the long-term trend toward centralization and bigness."" Zionist leader. Relatively late in life the secular Brandeis also became a prominent Zionist leader. He became active in the Federation of American Zionists in 1912, as a result of a conversation with Jacob de Haas, according to some. His involvement provided the nascent American Zionist movement one of the most distinguished men in American life and a friend of the next president. Over the next several years he devoted a great deal of his time, energy, and money to spreading the Zionist word. With the outbreak of World War I in Europe, the divided allegiance of its membership rendered the Zionist Organization impotent. American Jewry then assumed a larger responsibility independent of the Zionist Executive in Europe. The Provisional Executive Committee for Zionist Affairs was established in New York for this purpose on August 20, 1914, and, Brandeis was elected president of the organization. As president from 1914 to 1918, Brandeis became the leader of American Zionism. He embarked on a speaking tour in the fall and winter of 1914–1915 to garner support for the Zionist cause, emphasizing the goal of self-determination and freedom for Jews through the development of a Jewish homeland. Unlike the majority of American Jews at the time, he felt that the re-creation of a Jewish national homeland was one of the key solutions to antisemitism and the ""Jewish problem"" in Europe and Russia, while at the same time a way to ""revive the Jewish spirit."" He explained his belief in the importance of Zionism in a famous speech he gave at a conference of Reform Rabbis in April 1915: He also explained his belief that Zionism and patriotism were compatible concepts and should not lead to charges of ""dual loyalty"" which worried the rabbis and the dominant American Jewish Committee: Early in the war, Jewish leaders determined that they needed to elect a special representative body to attend the peace conference as spokesman for the religious, national and political rights of the Jews in certain European countries, especially to guarantee that Jewish minorities were included wherever minority rights were recognized. Under the leadership of Brandeis, Stephen Wise and Julian Mack, the Jewish Congress Organization Committee was established in March 1915. The subsequent vehement debate about the idea of a ""congress"" stirred American Jewry and acquainted it with the Jewish problem. Brandeis’ efforts to bring in the American Jewish Committee and some other Jewish organizations were unsuccessful; these organizations were quite willing to participate in a conference of appointed representatives, but were opposed to Brandeis's idea of convening a congress of delegates elected by the Jewish population. Nevertheless a year later, delegates representing over one million Jews came together in Philadelphia and elected a National Executive Committee with Brandeis as honorary chairman. On April 6, 1917, America entered the war. On June 10, 1917, 335,000 American Jews cast their votes and elected their delegates who, together with representatives of some 30 national organizations, established the American Jewish Congress on a democratically elected basis, but further efforts to organize awaited the end of the war. Brandeis also brought his influence to bear on the Wilson administration in the negotiations leading up to the Balfour Declaration and the Paris Peace Conference. In 1919 Brandeis broke on issues of structural organization and financial planning with Chaim Weizmann, the leader of European Zionism. In 1921 Weizmann's candidates, headed by Louis Lipsky, defeated Brandeis's for political control of the Zionist Organization of America. Brandeis resigned from the ZOA, along with his closest associates Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, Judge Julian W. Mack and Felix Frankfurter. His ouster was devastating to the movement, and by 1929 there were no more than 18,000 members in the ZOA. Nonetheless he remained active in philanthropy directed at Jews in Palestine. In the summer of 1930, these two factions and visions of Zionism, would come to a compromise largely on Brandeis's terms, with a changed leadership structure for the ZOA. In the late 1930s he endorsed immigration to Palestine in an effort to help European Jews escape genocide when Britain denied entry to more Jews. Death and legacy. Brandeis retired from the Supreme Court in February 1939, and he died on October 5, 1941, following a heart attack. The remains of both Justice Brandeis and his wife are interred beneath the portico of the Law School of the University of Louisville, in Louisville, Kentucky. Brandeis himself made the arrangements that made the law school one of only thirteen Supreme Court repositories in the U.S. His professional papers are archived at the library there. Brandeis lived to see many of the ideas that he had championed become the law of the land. Wages and hours legislation were now accepted as constitutional, and the right of labor to organize was protected by law. His spirited, eloquent defense of free speech and the right of privacy have had a continuing, powerful influence upon the Supreme Court and, ultimately, upon the life of the entire nation. The ""Economist"" magazine calls him ""A Robin Hood of the law,"" and former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, his early law clerk, was ""impressed by a man whose personal code called for ... the zealous molding of the lives of the underprivileged so that paupers might achieve moral growth."" Wayne McIntosh writes of him, ""In our national juristic temple, some figures have been accorded near-Olympian reverence... a part of that legal pantheon is Louis D. Brandeis – all the more so, perhaps because Brandeis was far more than a great justice. He was also a social reformer, legal innovator, labor champion, and Zionist leader... And it was as a judge that his concepts of privacy and free speech ultimately, if posthumously, resulted in virtual legal sea changes that continue to resonate even today."" Former Justice William O. Douglas wrote, ""he helped America grow to greatness by the dedications of which he made his life."" The U.S. Postal Service in September 2009 honored Brandeis by featuring his image on a new set of commemorative stamps along with U.S. Supreme Court associate justices Joseph Story, Felix Frankfurter and William J. Brennan Jr. In the Postal Service announcement about the stamp, he was credited with being ""the associate justice most responsible for helping the Supreme Court shape the tools it needed to interpret the Constitution in light of the sociological and economic conditions of the 20th century."" The Postal Service honored him with a stamp image in part because, their announcement states, he was ""a progressive and champion of reform, Brandeis devoted his life to social justice. He defended the right of every citizen to speak freely, and his groundbreaking conception of the right to privacy continues to impact legal thought today."" "
wikipedia-24102707," Modula-2  Modula-2 is a computer programming language designed and developed between 1977 and 1985 by Niklaus Wirth at ETH Zurich as a revision of Pascal to serve as the sole programming language for the operating system and application software for the personal workstation Lilith. The principal concepts were: Modula-2 was understood by Niklaus Wirth as a successor to his earlier programming language Pascal. The language design was also influenced by the Mesa programming language and the new programming possibilities of the early personal computer Xerox Alto, both from Xerox, that Wirth saw during his 1976 sabbatical year at Xerox PARC. The computer magazine BYTE devoted the issue August 1984 to the language and its surrounding environment. Description. Modula-2 is a general purpose procedural language, sufficiently flexible to do systems programming, but with much broader application. In particular, it was designed to support separate compilation and data abstraction in a straightforward way. Much of the syntax is based on Wirth's earlier and better-known language, Pascal. Modula-2 was designed to be broadly similar to Pascal, with some elements and syntactic ambiguities removed and the important addition of the ""module"" concept, and direct language support for multiprogramming. Here is an example of the source code for the ""Hello world"" program: The Modula-2 ""module"" may be used to encapsulate a set of related subprograms and data structures, and restrict their visibility from other portions of the program. The module design implemented the data abstraction feature of Modula-2 in a very clean way. Modula-2 programs are composed of modules, each of which is made up of two parts: a definition module, the interface portion, which contains only those parts of the subsystem that are ""exported"" (visible to other modules), and an implementation module, which contains the working code that is internal to the module. The language has strict scope control. In particular the scope of a module can be considered as an impenetrable wall: Except for standard identifiers no object from the outer world is visible inside a module unless explicitly imported; no internal module object is visible from the outside unless explicitly exported. Suppose module M1 exports objects a, b, c, and P by enumerating its identifiers in an explicit export list Then the objects a, b,c, and P from module M1 become now known outside module M1 as M1.a, M1.b, M1.c, and M1.P. They are exported in a ""qualified"" manner to the universe (assumed module M1 is global). The exporting module's name, i.e. M1, is used as a qualifier followed by the object's name. Suppose module M2 contains the following IMPORT declaration Then this means that the objects exported by module M1 to the universe of its enclosing program can now be used inside module M2. They are referenced in a ""qualified"" manner like this: M1.a, M1.b, M1.c, and M1.P. Example: Qualified export avoids name clashes: For instance, if another module M3 would also export an object called P, then we can still distinguish the two objects, since M1.P differs from M3.P. Thanks to the qualified export it does not matter that both objects are called P inside their exporting modules M1 and M3. There is an alternative technique available, which is in wide use by Modula-2 programmers. Suppose module M4 is formulated as this Then this means that objects exported by module M1 to the universe can again be used inside module M4, but now by mere references to the exported identifiers in an ""unqualified"" manner like this: a, b, c, and P. Example: This technique of unqualifying import allows use of variables and other objects outside their exporting module in exactly the same simple, i.e. ""unqualified"", manner as inside the exporting module. The walls surrounding all modules have now become irrelevant for all those objects for which this has been explicitly allowed. Of course unqualifying import is only usable if there are no name clashes. These export and import rules may seem unnecessarily restrictive and verbose. But they do not only safeguard objects against unwanted access, but also have the pleasant side-effect of providing automatic cross-referencing of the definition of every identifier in a program: if the identifier is qualified by a module name, then the definition comes from that module. Otherwise if it occurs unqualified, simply search backwards, and you will either encounter a declaration of that identifier, or its occurrence in an IMPORT statement which names the module it comes from. This property becomes very useful when trying to understand large programs containing many modules. The language provides for (limited) single-processor concurrency (monitors, coroutines and explicit transfer of control) and for hardware access (absolute addresses, bit manipulation, and interrupts). It uses name equivalence. Dialects. There are two major dialects of Modula-2. The first is PIM, named after the book ""Programming in Modula-2"" by Niklaus Wirth. There were three major editions of PIM, the second, third (corrected) and fourth editions, each describing slight variants of the language. The second major dialect is ISO, from the standardization effort by the International Organization for Standardization. Supersets.

wikipedia-24102765," UD Salamanca  Unión Deportiva Salamanca, S.A.D. () was a Spanish football team based in Salamanca, in the autonomous community of Castile and León. Founded on 16 March 1923, it played its last season in Segunda División B. Nicknamed ""Los Charros"", the club played in white shirts and black shorts, holding home games at ""Estadio El Helmántico"", which seated 17,341 spectators. History. Initially formed by Irish students, Salamanca first played in early Spanish championships in 1907, before an official league was founded later on. On 16 March 1923, at the tables of Café Novelty, situated in the Plaza Mayor, Dionisio Ridruejo set the club's early official foundations and, from 1939 and during the following three decades, it fluctuated between the third and the second levels of the Spanish football league.  In the 1974–75 season, Salamanca made its La Liga debuts, overachieving for a final 7th position (out of 18 teams), which eventually would be its best classification ever. The team lasted in the topflight until 1981, mainly coached by José Luis García Traid, then returned the following year for a further two seasons, being further relegated to ""Segunda División B"" – the new third division created in 1977 – in 1984–85, and spending three years in that category before promoting back. In 1994–95's second division, after finishing fourth in the league, Salamanca lost the first leg of the promotion/relegation playoffs against Albacete Balompié, 0–2 at home, but won 5–0 away, returning to the main level after eleven years. The club was managed by 29-year-old Juan Manuel Lillo, also in charge for the following season, as the Castile and León club ranked 22nd and last in the top level. From 1999 onwards (with two more visits to the first division, with 15th and 20th-place finishes respectively), Salamanca stabilized in the second level, save for the 2005–06 season spent in the third division, with the club winning the regular season and promoting in the playoffs. Veteran Quique Martín was arguably the most important player of the club in the decade, whilst Argentine Jorge D'Alessandro, who held the record for most games in the top division in the club's history, worked with the team as a manager in a further two spells (three in total).  2010–11 brought a club record ten consecutive defeats between December 2010/February 2011, and two coaching changes, as Salamanca returned to the third division after five years. On 18 June 2013, 90 years after its foundation, the club was liquidated due to the accumulation of unpaid debts. Last squad.

wikipedia-24102946," GLaDOS  GLaDOS, short for Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System, is a fictional artificially intelligent computer system and the main antagonist in the video game ""Portal"" as well as the first half of its sequel, ""Portal 2"". She was created by Erik Wolpaw and Kim Swift and is voiced by Ellen McLain. She is responsible for testing and maintenance in Aperture Science research facility in both video games. While she initially appears to simply be a voice to guide and aid the player, her words and actions become increasingly malicious until she makes her intentions clear. The game reveals that she is corrupted and used a neurotoxin to kill the scientists in the lab before the events of ""Portal"". She is destroyed at the end of the first title by the player-character Chell but is revealed to have survived in the credits song ""Still Alive"". The inspiration for her creation extends from Wolpaw's use of a text-to-speech program while writing lines for the video game ""Psychonauts"". Other ""Psychonauts"" designers were finding the lines funnier as a result of the text-to-speech voice. GLaDOS was originally intended to be used in the first area of ""Portal""; she was well-received by other designers and her role was expanded as a result. Play testers were motivated to complete tests in the game due to her guidance. While the game was originally designed to have other characters, they later decided to remove them and leave GLaDOS as the only character players encounter. The physical appearance of GLaDOS went through several designs, one which featured a large disk below her. McLain imitated dialog written in a text-to-speech program with her own voice, which was later processed to sound more robotic. She also sang the lyrics for ""Still Alive"", written by Jonathan Coulton, which played during the credits of ""Portal"". The song became hugely successful; it appeared in the ""Rock Band"" series and has been a popular song for YouTube users to cover. GLaDOS has been well-received by critics and gamers, some of whom called her narcissistic, passive-aggressive, sinister, and witty. She is considered one of the greatest video game characters, particularly among those created between 2000 to 2009. She was universally praised for her contributions to the quality of ""Portal""s narrative and was awarded multiple awards for best new character in 2007 from GameSpy, ""GamePro"", and ""X-Play"". A number of websites and magazines listed her as one of the greatest video game villains, including IGN, which ranked her first all-time. She has been the subject of significant analysis from both journalists and video game developers, who have compared her to other villainous computer systems in fiction, including HAL 9000 from """" and SHODAN from ""System Shock"". Description. For much of ""Portal"", GLaDOS is a voice that acts as a narrator and guide for players. Her voice is robotic, but distinctly female. Over time, players learn that she is in fact leading the player-character Chell to her death. Her personality has been described as passive-aggressive, witty, narcissistic, and sinister. She has a number of system personality cores installed into her, partly in order to prevent her from killing anyone (other than the ones she already did before the failsafes were installed). Eventually, once the player encounters her, she is revealed to be a complex computer, with robotic parts hanging from a larger device. Once the player removes the first personality core, the morality core, GLaDOS' voice becomes less robotic and more sensual. Originally, GLaDOS was designed as an artificial intelligence and research assistant meant to aid Aperture Science in their goal of beating Black Mesa to the creation of portal technology. Later proposed uses for GLaDOS included implementation as a fuel line ice inhibitor and disk operating system. The AI of GLaDOS is installed as the Enrichment Center's central control computer, mounted in a large, sealed chamber alongside control consoles and an incinerator, which is eventually used to destroy her. In ""Portal 2"", a character named Wheatley is introduced. It is eventually revealed that he was a personality core that was once attached to her, and was designed to give her bad ideas to inhibit her personality. It is also learned that while she is attached to the Aperture Science facility, she is driven to test, and given a euphoric sensation when a test is complete. However, once she is removed from her position, she begins to act more civil with Chell. It further emerges that GLaDOS has inherited the personality of a woman named Caroline who worked as a personal assistant to Aperture Science's CEO Cave Johnson. She is much warmer when under the influence of Caroline's personality. Plot. ""Portal"". In ""Portal"", she is Chell's only link with the situation she is placed in; at the game's start, GLaDOS introduces Chell to the game's Enrichment Center and the physics of the portal gun. In later stages of the center, GLaDOS admits to having lied to Chell about her progress, as part of a supposed 'test protocol.' GLaDOS slowly becomes more sinister, and Chell's trust in GLaDOS is tested when the AI directs Chell into a testing area populated with live-fire turrets, a course designed for military androids. The AI claims that the regular test chamber is unavailable due to ""mandatory scheduled maintenance"". GLaDOS uses the lure of cake and grief counseling to encourage Chell to continue, but at the final testing area, as Chell prepares to receive the supposed cake, GLaDOS attempts to incinerate Chell in a fire pit. Once Chell escapes, GLaDOS attempts to reconcile with Chell, claiming the pit was a final test. Chell then travels through the bowels of the Enrichment Center, battling natural hazards and further turrets until she reaches GLaDOS's chamber, where the final encounter occurs. In this encounter Chell dislodges ""personality cores"" (each also voiced by McLain, with the exception of the final core, which is voiced in a guttural fashion by Mike Patton) and incinerates them. During the battle, it is revealed that before the events of ""Portal"", GLaDOS released a neurotoxin into the Enrichment Center, which resulted in the scientists installing a morality core to stop GLaDOS flooding the Enrichment Center. After the cores are incinerated, the room is sucked into a vortex leading to the surface and GLaDOS is destroyed. Originally the game ended with a fade to black leaving Chell on the surface. This ending was however replaced in a later patch to the game to a new one in which an unconscious Chell is dragged away by the party escort robot (a character referenced earlier in the game). The final scene shows a room filled with more personality cores that begin to light up and a robotic hand puts out a candle on a cake. ""Portal 2"". In ""Portal 2"", GLaDOS initially resumes her role as test monitor in a now-ruined facility after Wheatley inadvertently reactivates her. This time, she makes no attempt to hide her contempt and hatred for Chell; this is partly because Chell outwitted her, and partly because a backup system has forced her to relive her death over and over since her deactivation. Soon after she repairs the facility, a plot twist occurs when Wheatley convinces Chell to perform a core transfer, putting him in charge of the facility in place of GLaDOS. At this point he almost immediately becomes power-mad and puts GLaDOS into a potato battery after she tells him what he was originally designed for - an idiotic personality designed to hobble her. He then turns on Chell and slams the elevator they are in, sending both into the bowels of the facility. GLaDOS is kidnapped by a bird and later saved by Chell, who teams up with GLaDOS to escape from the facility. While they are escaping from the old testing facility, GLaDOS discovers that she was an assistant to former Aperture CEO Cave Johnson named Caroline, who was later uploaded into the GLaDOS program. The two of them find their way back to the testing facility, where Wheatley tasks them with completing tests until he springs a trap upon them and fails to kill them. Once they find Wheatley's lair, they cause him to become corrupted and switch GLaDOS back in charge of the facility. Anticipating the outcome, Wheatley boobytraps the trigger system. GLaDOS rescues Chell, and shows relief for her safety. However, GLaDOS is able to discover where Caroline is in her brain, and subsequently deletes her, reverting to her old self. Nevertheless, she decides that it is in her best interest to let Chell go, as GLaDOS learned the easiest solution is usually the best one, and felt that killing Chell was hard. Development history. Before development of GLaDOS had begun, Erik Wolpaw was writing the script for the video game ""Psychonauts"", where he went around the office, finding people to provide voices to the words until they could add the final voices to the game. Once he ran out of people, however, he began using a text-to-speech program. According to Wolpaw, people found the lines funnier than they were worth. He commented that ""no amount of writing is funnier than this text-to-speech thing reading it."" He became bitter about that, stating that he would leverage this and use it to his advantage. The creation of GLaDOS began with a discussion between the Valve team and Wolpaw on the narrative constraints they had to deal with. When they were designing the game, they found that they did not have enough time or staffing to use human characters, due to the amount of animation work and scene choreography involved. A week later, to alleviate this problem, Wolpaw returned with sample dialogue made with a text-to-speech program, which was intended to be used as a series of messages relayed to the player in the relaxation vault, the first area of the game. The team liked the voice, describing it as ""funny"" and ""sinister"", so Wolpaw decided to add this voice to other test chambers, all the while trying to think of story elements. The developers noticed that play testers were more motivated by the voice because they became attached to it. As a result, the team decided to make GLaDOS the narrative voice of ""Portal"". While designing GLaDOS, one of the rules that the writers had was that they would not make her seem like a computer, for example having her say, ""Oh my nuts and bolts."" While GLaDOS is physically a computer and speaks with a computerized voice, they intended her to speak to the player-character like a regular person. GLaDOS' physical appearance went through several iterations when Valve had Jason Brashill help drive the visual creation of GLaDOS. Early designs used for her included a floating brain, a spider-like appearance, and an upside-down version of Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus with the four personality cores around her body. Eventually, they settled on the design of the robotic figure hanging upside down. This was done to convey both a sense of raw mechanical power and femininity. A large disk with the four personality cores hanging from it was added to her design, when she was still just a sphere standing above it. However, the team found it to be too small, giving her a body and putting it below the disk. Another early design was when GLaDOS was only a cube, which was used for the removed laser battle mentioned below. The large chamber that the player-character encounters was the result of the team wanting to build a space that brought a great deal of attention to her. GLaDOS was written with the intent of making her more understandable and empathetic to players, making her villainy more tragic. Kim Swift, team leader of ""Portal"", described her growth in the game as her becoming more and more human. The two-hour total playtime for ""Portal"" allowed the writers enough time to let players get to know GLaDOS. Wolpaw commented that while GLaDOS did yell and fire rockets at the player, she fulfilled his desire for a villain who has not been ""done to death"". He described her as both supportive and funny, while also sad and scared. One of his intentions was for players to believe that they are ""putting her through the wringer emotionally."" The game was designed to have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Wolpaw stated that with each new part, GLaDOS' personality changed. She begins as a supportive, yet also increasingly sinister character, where she delivers exposition about the general Aperture mindset. However, once the player-character escapes, she begins to speak in first-person singular rather than first-person plural. She shows desperation due to her lack of control at this point, adding that more emotion begins to creep through her voice. After destroying the morality core, she becomes unhinged, featuring an almost human voice. This voice, described as sultry by Wolpaw, was originally to be used for turrets, but it did not work out. Because they liked it so much, they chose to use it for GLaDOS. Valve described GLaDOS' actions in ""Portal 2"" as attempting to build a relationship with the player-character, and the only way to accomplish this is by testing her. Voice design. In creating the voice for GLaDOS, voice actress Ellen McLain attempted to sound like a computer. This was accomplished by her emulating a computer-generated voice that the Valve team played for her and her adding emotion to lines when appropriate. While designing her voice, Swift commented that it was difficult to write some of the lines for GLaDOS, describing McLain as ""super likable"", and that they should write for that. She also performed the song ""Still Alive"", which features GLaDOS singing to the effect that she is still alive by the end of ""Portal"". This song was written by Jonathan Coulton, who was approached by the team and asked if he would want to write a song for them. He later decided that it would be a good idea to do a song featuring one of the voices from the game that would tie up the story at the end. Swift stated that the team wanted the players to leave the game happy, leading to them implementing the song in the first place. Wolpaw and the other writers wrote down a list of things that would make people happy, which resulted in ""Still Alive"". In discussing the difficulties in singing the song as GLaDOS, McLain listed one of the difficulties as breathing, because computers do not need to breathe. As a result, she had to sing the phrases in one breath, while attempting to keep a clean, even tone. Swift commented in an interview that one of the focuses of developing the game was for players to hear GLaDOS and hear her song. GLaDOS continues to be voiced by McLain in ""Portal 2"", who worked with Valve every two weeks to record the majority of the dialogue for the game. The frequency of her voice sessions allowed Valve to experiment with GLaDOS's lines and how they came out within the final game. After finding that ""Still Alive"" was a large part of ""Portal's"" success, Valve included more music in ""Portal 2"", including further involvement from Coulton. Coulton wrote a new song for the game's ending credits, ""Want You Gone"", which is written from GLaDOS's viewpoint of wanting to rid herself of Chell. It is performed by McLain. The writers found they needed another character to play off of ""Portal 2's"" Cave Johnson during his recordings; instead of hiring a voice actor for a few lines, they economized by reusing McLain to play Caroline, Cave's assistant. This led naturally to providing a backstory for the creation of GLaDOS, who is revealed in-game to be Caroline who was put into GLaDOS. This later led the writers to develop a full story arc for GLaDOS where she would come to recall her past, learn from it to solve the dilemma and then subsequently delete it and reset herself. Final battle. In designing the final 'encounter' with GLaDOS in ""Portal"", one of the important aspects to it was giving the players a predisposition to the Weighted Companion Cube, an object that GLaDOS gives to the player-character and tells her to protect. This was accomplished by forcing the player to incinerate it, therein providing a tutorial for how to defeat the boss and a revenge angle. GLaDOS was originally designed to be a devious boss, citing one form where she would use a series of lasers, like those seen in ""James Bond"" films. However, it was determined that this twitch gameplay distracted players from GLaDOS, and was too different from the game's puzzle-solving gameplay. Additionally, it was difficult for players to detect when they were hit, so the developers switched the gameplay to feature rockets. This incarnation of the final boss was dubbed ""Portal Kombat,"" which Swift describes as a ""high intensity rocket battle."" However, Wolpaw disliked it because no one was paying attention to what GLaDOS was saying. While it went over well with hardcore shooter fans, the people who liked the puzzle-focused gameplay were turned off by it. The third boss was a chase scene, with players pursuing GLaDOS down a corridor. Wolpaw sharply criticized the pacing, which caused the players to wander around until they found the corridor, at which point a series of pistons would spring out of the walls. The developers came to the conclusion that complex battles would only serve to confuse players. One play tester helped them by pointing out the quality of the fire pit puzzle, a puzzle that has the player-character riding on a moving platform that is descending into flames, requiring players to find a way to survive. He stated that it was both dramatic and exciting, but also a difficult puzzle. Wolpaw stated that this made no sense, commenting that it was one of the easiest puzzles in the game. He added that the battle was a dramatic high-point, since it was being the first time GLaDOS directly tries to kill the player-character and the first time that players have to use the environment to their advantage. After learning about what fellow Valve developers had planned for the final boss battle in ""Half-Life 2: Episode Two"", the Portal developers decided to implement a neurotoxin that would kill the player-character in six minutes. This made it easier on the writers, who only had to write six minutes of dialogue. As a result, they scaled the game back, intending to ensure that everyone was able to see the game to the very end. In ""Portal 2"". Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton were mainly responsible for the single player campaign's story, while Chet Faliszek focused on the lines for GLaDOS in the cooperative campaign. ""Portal 2"" was originally not intended to feature GLaDOS or Chell, the player-character from ""Portal"". However, the demand for all of these to be implemented into ""Portal 2"" was great enough that they chose to do so. Originally, the character Cave Johnson was intended to be the antagonist instead and ""Portal 2"" to be a prequel. Before implementing Chell, they considered introducing a new player-character who would at one point inadvertently reactivate GLaDOS. During play testing, Wolpaw found that there were two groups that were ""at-odds"": one group was excited to see GLaDOS return, while the other did not want to wake her up and questioned why players would want to do that. As such, the character Wheatley was introduced, who inadvertently wakes GLaDOS while trying to escape the facilities with Chell. Wheatley and GLaDOS served as a contrasts to each other; where GLaDOS has a more ""computery-sounding"" voice due to her intelligence, Wheatley ""sounded perfectly human"" due to his lack of it. Play testers were also bothered by the fact that the new protagonist was not recognized by GLaDOS when she awoke; as such, they changed the new character back into Chell. Wolpaw and the designers were not sure what to do with GLaDOS and were wary to do the same thing as the last game. They felt that she should ""go someplace"" and that since GLaDOS is ""kind of likeable in the first game"" and players ""enjoy being with her"", they would utilize Wheatley as an ""other, external threat"". In the early part of the game, GLaDOS introduces each chamber and congratulates the player on completing it; though they could have included intermediate dialog from GLaDOS while the player attempts to solve each chamber, they found this would be distracting to players and limited her presence in the game to only these points. The developers considered having GLaDOS and Chell act as ""buddy cops against a new threat"", but felt that since Chell never talked, it would not work. He compared her transformation into a potato and having her power stripped away to the game Jenga: ""You’re taking stuff off the bottom and seeing what happens."" While she was in the potato form, the designers noticed a ""very stark difference between this imperious, all-powerful GLaDOS talking to you, and this powerless GLaDOS talking to you on your gun"". They found that play testers were not interested in her when she was powerless and insulting players and would question why they were ""carting this person along"". They decided to give her a personality shift and become Chell's ""sidekick"" on the basis that ""she can’t just be needling you for a half hour"". In order to keep players from feeling that they should want to abandon GLaDOS in her powerless form to prevent her from becoming powerful again, the designers made sure to give players reason to bring her with them. In considering the interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, Erik Johnson compared GLaDOS to ""a jealous ex-girlfriend"", noting ""is the only person she can have interaction with, but the problem is her only way of interacting with anyone is to test them"". While they introduced new characters into the game, the focus of the story in ""Portal 2"" remained the connection and interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, and focuses more on the fallout from Chell's destruction of GLaDOS from the first game. The co-operative campaign contains a separate story between the two robotic characters and GLaDOS. The co-operative campaign includes additional dialog from GLaDOS; the original dialog Wolpaw wrote for GLaDOS was aimed to two women, Chell and a new character ""Mel"", with the assumption of ""image issues"", but this dialog remains in place even after the change of the co-op characters to robots. The dialog written for GLaDOS in the co-operative campaign is aimed to try to break the bond between the two robot characters. Valve considered initially to have separate lines for GLaDOS that would be given to each player individually, but found this to be a significant effort for minimal benefit. The writers also attempted adding GLaDOS lines that would make the players attempt to compete against each other, such as the awarding of meaningless points, but playtesters did not respond well to these lines. The writers found they needed another character to play off of Cave during his recordings; instead of hiring a voice actor for a few lines, they economized by reusing McLain to play Caroline, Cave's assistant. This led naturally to providing a backstory for the creation of GLaDOS, who is revealed in-game to be based on Caroline's personality. This later led the writers to develop a full story arc for GLaDOS where she would come to recall her past, learn from it to solve the dilemma and then subsequently delete it and reset herself. The designers wanted to start GLaDOS' role in ""Portal 2"" off with her being ""incredibly upset at They felt however that this would ""get old pretty quick"" if they did not put her ""into another space"". They accomplished this through a combination of her anger with Wheatley and her conflict with her past life as Caroline. Through the course of the game's events, GLaDOS' personality shifts significantly; however, at the end, she resets her personality to her original personality, an action Wolpaw sums up as ""explicitly reject[ing it"" and saying ""You know what? Done."" While they wanted to give players the sense that they had defeated GLaDOS, they felt that they should not have players fight her as a boss battle; as a result, they had her let Chell go due to the reasoning that Chell was too difficult for her to handle. Writer Jay Pinkerton stated that GLaDOS was an exemplification of a villain who can go from ""genuinely tender"" to ""genuinely villainous"" and that ""she’s not just this moustache-twirling villain"". He also stated that she has a ""passive-aggressive nature"" and will never ""overtly attack, it’s always these subtle mind games"". The designers also intended to make it vague whether or not GLaDOS was under the control of the machine that she was attached to. Wolpaw also called her ""passive aggressive"" as well as ""mildly sarcastic"" and compared her to ""The Sopranos"" character Livia Soprano. Use in promotion. GLaDOS has been used several times for reveals in the ""Portal"" series. At E3 2008, GLaDOS' voice was utilized to reveal the ""Portal"" expansion ""Portal: Still Alive"". She has also been used to show ""Portal 2"" reveals; initially, a Blue Screen of Death image was used instead of a reveal of ""Portal 2"", showing the typical text found in a blue screen of death, but with GLaDOS' name at the top. In the reveal of the PlayStation 3 version of ""Portal 2"", GLaDOS' voice was used to introduce Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve Software at E3 2010, where he revealed ""Portal 2"" for the PlayStation 3. ""Portal 2""s release was preceded by a collection of video games in a collection called ""Potato Sack"", which featured thirteen independently developed games. These games were all a part of an alternate reality, based on a cryptic narrative that suggested the awakening and relaunch of GLaDOS. Valve provided the developers access to their art assets to include ""Portal 2""-themed content into them, and in some cases, McLain recorded new dialog specifically for these games. The alternate reality game ultimately led to ""GLaDOS@Home"", a distributed computing spoof, which prompted players to play the independently-developed games to awaken GLaDOS ahead of schedule, effectively promoting the Steam release of ""Portal 2"" about 10 hours earlier than the official time. Cultural impact. GLaDOS' popularity has led to merchandise being produced by both Valve and fans; a t-shirt depicting GLaDOS, as well as other elements from ""Portal"", was made available for purchase on Valve's store while a fan produced a GPS which uses GLaDOS' voice. A cosmetics vendor called ""Geek Chic Cosmetics"" features several video game-themed makeups, including one based on GLaDOS. The song ""Still Alive"" has garnered significant attention from fans and critics alike. It was released as a part of ""The Orange Box Official Soundtrack"" and appeared in other video games, including the ""Rock Band"" series and ""Left 4 Dead 2"", the latter which was also released by Valve. The song has been performed in multiple venues by Jonathan Coulton which includes the Penny Arcade Expo in 2008, the Press Start -Symphony of Games- concert in 2009, and the Game Developers Conference in 2008. The song is popular for fans to perform covers of on YouTube. Ellen McLain voices a computer AI in Guillermo del Toro's 2013 film ""Pacific Rim""; her voice work is deliberately similar to GLaDOS, a Valve-approved nod to the character and ""Portal"" series. When announcing McLain's addition to the cast, del Toro stated that he is a ""big fan of Valve"" and highlighted ""Portal"" and ""Left 4 Dead"" as ""instrumental family experiences"" in his home. Del Toro contacted Newell directly to secure McLain's voice, with his daughter's influence on the call helping to finalize the deal. GLaDOS appears as the dealer in the crossover title ""Poker Night 2"", and will be part of an upcoming announcer pack for Valve's ""Dota 2"". Reception and analysis. Paste Magazine's Jason Killingsworth listed GLaDOS as the sixth best new character of the decade; he wrote that she ""may just be the most likable villain in video-game history"" and that ""we only killed her because we had to"". An editor for GamesRadar also called her one of the best new characters of the decade. Epic Games design director Cliff Bleszinski stated that he was motivated to complete test chambers in ""Portal"". He also compared her to an ex-girlfriend who sent text messages that went from friendly, to aggressive, and finally to apologetic. GamesRadar's Justin Towell called her the third-most difficult game bad guy to kill due to Stockholm syndrome, a syndrome where hostages will bond with their captors. IGN editor Daemon Hatfield described GLaDOS as one of the most engaging characters to appear in a video game. Cinema Blend featured GLaDOS as the best character of 2007, stating that she ""breathes life, emotion, and hilarity into the lab of ""Portal""."" GamesRadar praised ""Portal"" as having one of the best video game stories ever, citing GLaDOS as the primary reason for this. They stated that she had one of the most defined personalities in gaming, adding that she ""redefined passive-aggressive."" Shoot 'em up expert Michael Molinari cited GLaDOS as an example of a quality boss, stating that her quality stems from her appearing throughout the game, providing motivation as well as a satisfying pay-off at the end of the game. Editor Randy Smith commented that the battle with GLaDOS was ""easy,"" commenting that it was ""fun and fluid"" rather than ""annoyingly insurmountable."" However, he added that it had an ""air of epicness."" Whereas Smith found the battle easy, UGO Networks Chris Littler included GLaDOS in his list of the 50 ""Hardest Freakin' Boss Battles."" UGO.com listed GLaDOS as one of their favourite video game robots. Awards. GLaDOS has won several awards in 2007 for her role in ""Portal"". IGN editor Hilary Goldstein awarded her the ""Best of the Worst Guiding Voices"", commenting that it was between her and ""BioShock"" character Atlas. However, he gave the award to GLaDOS, citing her humor as the prime reason. GameSpy awarded her the ""Best Character"" award, stating that she came from the most unexpected place – a game that could have gotten by without a story. They added that during the final encounter, her mood swings provided some of the most memorable dialogue in video game history. X-Play similarly awarded her with the best new character award. GamePro awarded GLaDOS, referred to as ""The Voice"" in their article, the most memorable villain award, describing the decision as a surprise upset, considering either Frank Fontaine of ""BioShock"" or Saren of ""Mass Effect"" to win. GLaDOS has received other awards, including ""best nemesis of 2007"" from Primo Technology, best new character from GameSpot, and character of the year from Man!ac. ""Game Informer"" also named GLaDOS one of the Characters Who Defined a Decade, in terms of storytelling and also was voted number 1 best videogame character out of 100. Runner up was Bowser. Villainy and humor. GLaDOS is frequently cited as both a quality villain and a quality computer character. IGN called her the greatest video game villain of all time, stating that while their time with her was short, she left a mark on players like no other villain has. They cited her uniqueness as being because no other players existed in the game. They also added she was more human than most video game villains. 1UP.com editor Scott Sharkey praised her as being the best insane video game computer. He stated that not only is she the best insane computer in video games, but in films and books as well. He explains his choice by citing her eagerness to kill the player-character, but not being overt about it until the end. He also cites her feminine voice and passive-aggressive manner for his decision. In another article, he mentions how he feels more sorry for her than any other enemy, describing her as a ""digital version of the most passive-aggressive girlfriend ever."" He adds that he can imagine it not being easy to be a super-intelligent computer trapped in a single building. ""Crave"" editor Rich Trenholm also regarded her highly, listing her as the fifth best evil computer. ""PC World"" editor Spandas Lui listed GLaDOS as the second most ""big-time, badass video game villain"", citing her various non-sequitur one-liners and personality for her becoming one of the most memorable video game villains ever. Pittsburgh Live editor Jessica Severs described GLaDOS as having the most entertaining villainy due to her promises of cake and her encouragements such as ""This next test is impossible."" GameDaily listed her as the most horrific video game boss, describing her as ""polite, passive-aggressive, and insanely sadistic."" The review adds that while the game may be short, GLaDOS will ""resonate with players long after players finish it."" ""Game Informer"" considered GLaDOS the top defining video game character of the 2000s (decade), taking the archetype of the sentient computer in ""surprising new directions, at turns slyly comic and malevolent"", and that she remains ""one of the most fascinating characters in game history"". GLaDOS has received praise for her humor and wit. In his review of ""Portal"", ""PC Gamer"" editor Tom Francis stated that he could hardly stop himself from laughing at GLaDOS' deranged writing. Similarly, GamesRadar editor Tom Francis described her as hysterical and being an aspect of ""Portal"" that gamers will love. Tom Francis called GLaDOS as one of the most badass boss fights in video games, citing both the hilarity of the character, with whom they state as the funniest video game villain since the Purple Tentacle from ""Day of the Tentacle"", as well as the memorable quotes. PC Zone UK listed her as the second-best conceived character in gaming, commenting that the memes related to the Weighted Companion Cube and ""the cake is a lie"" could distract people from GLaDOS' ""perfectly-metered and lyrical voice."" He described her as the ""humorous, clinical, savage and poignant heart of ""Portal""."" In a piece in The Observer, game theorist and author of Fun Inc Tom Chatfield listed GLaDOS as one of the ten best video game characters of all time, describing her as both as ""gaming's funniest, freakiest female"" and a ""psychopathic artificial intelligence."" ""The Observer""s Will Freeman wrote that GLaDOS ""really is (in a rare case of living up to the hyperbole) one of the most fascinating characters in the history of the video game"". The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences praised ""Portal"" for its ""hint of comedy,"" citing GLaDOS' ""humorous and homicidal"" personality. Writer Lou Kesten, in discussing humor in video games, cited GLaDOS as possibly being the first time he discovered that video games could make him laugh out loud. New York Times editor Charles Herold praised GLaDOS, calling her comments ""wildly funny."" In an article titled ""The GLaDOS Effect - Can Antagonists Rule the World?"", Gamasutra publisher Simon Carless describes her as the one true memorable character from ""Portal"". He states that she is the reason he keeps returning to play ""Portal"", describing her as funny, unexpected, and beguiling. ""The Telegraph""s Tom Hoggins wrote that GLaDOS ""became one of gaming’s most compelling villains"" and that ""it managed to get people attached to an inanimate cube. It had the best end credits song of all time. It was funny, smart, fresh and managed to feel like the plucky, accidental hero"". GameSpy's Nathan Meunier wrote that ""without inhuman antagonist GLaDOS spewing a laugh-inducing tirade of thinly veiled threats in her deadpan robotic drone as you progress deeper into the bowels of Aperture Science, Portal would have been a very different game"". GLaDOS' mocking of Chell was met with negative reception from Neal Stapel, an adoptive parent. He stated that ""it literally pokes fun for not having parents"", and stopped playing when he first heard the insult. He added that ""it throws the ultimate question that that child is ever going to have for you... and it just throws it right in the living room."" Kotaku's Michael McWhertor felt that while it was ""awkward"" for the parents, the fact that GLaDOS was trying to kill Chell would be more upsetting. He also pointed out that ""morons and the overweight are also mocked by robots"" in ""Portal 2"". 1UP.com's Chris Pereira found the joke ""harmless"". In ""Portal 2"". GLaDOS' appearance in ""Portal 2"" received critical acclaim. GameSpot's Chris Watters wrote that GLaDOS was a ""complex character who evolves throughout these early levels"" and that ""before all is said and done, you'll once again come to cherish your relationship with that cruel AI"". PALGN's Adam Ghiggino called Ellen McLain's portrayal of GLaDOS ""hilariously blunt"" due to her calling the player-character fat. He also wrote that GLaDOS has ""a lot of emotion to movement"". ""The Guardian""s Nick Cowen wrote that GLaDOS was ""by turns funny and monstrous"". Computer and Video Game's Andy Robinson wrote that GLaDOS was ""surely now deserving of entry into the Best Game Characters Ever club"". He added that ""GlaDOS's character progression is a joy to follow, as she progresses from bitter, to angry and eventually even finding a bit of heart"". An editor for GameTrailers wrote that GLaDOS' ""constant auto-tuned barbs are extremely well-written and voiced-helping lend some character to an otherwise spartan presentation"". GameZone's Ben PerLee wrote that GLaDOS was the ""much brighter star of the franchise"" compared to Chell due to her role in ""Portal"". He also wrote ""the player’s interaction with her is absolutely amazing to watch. She is as vindictive and bitchy as ever, coating pure unadulterated hatred with a veneer of cool science"" and that ""for fans of GLaDOS, her return from her unfortunate death in the previous Portal is fabulous, and her literal transformation within the game will shock, wow, and humor even jaded gamers tired of cake quotes"". ""PC Gamer""s Dan Stapleton wrote that ""evil robot GLaDOS is in top politely murderous form right from the moment she appears on screen"" and that """"Portal""s show-stealing monotone antagonist is challenged for the spotlight by Wheatley"". He compared her to Cave Johnson, who has a similar ""comically sociopathic approach to science"". Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis wrote ""it would be charitable to characterize GlaDOS as indignantly sociopathic, and her lust for punishing you for your past transgressions is riper than ever"". CNN's Larry Frum wrote that ""GLaDOS's voice is dripping with sarcasm and malice even as her tone remains soothing and calm"". ""PC Mag""s Matthew Murray called her voice actor ""irreplaceable"" and called GLaDOS ""saucy and strangely sympathetic"". The ""Daily Mail""s James O'Brien wrote that GLaDOS had ""some of the sharpest, funniest lines we will hear in any fictional form this year, not just video games"". An editor for CBS News wrote that ""the interactions between the player, GLaDOS and Wheatley are what give """"Portal 2"""" its charm and provide much of the humor that keeps the game captivating puzzle after puzzle"". ""The Globe and Mail""s Chad Sepieha listed the top five insults from GLaDOS in ""Portal 2"", which included ""Science has now validated your birth mother’s decision to abandon you on a doorstep."" Rock Paper Shotgun's John Walker wrote that ""Ellen McLain returns as GLaDOS, and is pushed so much further this time, hitting every single line with perfection"". ""Game Informer""s Adam Biessener wrote that while ""Portal 2"" was less quotable than its predecessor, ""repeating GLaDOS lines stopped being funny a long time ago"". He also wrote ""I never once thought I'd place GLaDOS second on any list of """"Portal"""" characters, but J.K. Simmons' character surpasses the malevolent AI even though she's as amusing as ever"". Comparison to other characters in fiction. GLaDOS has been compared to characters in fiction, including HAL 9000 from the film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by LucasArts designer Noah Falstein. He wrote that GLaDOS was ""more convincingly psychotic"" than HAL and that her dialogue was not typical ""like HAL['s]"". Falstein described her as the best AI he had ever encountered – ""more convincingly psychotic than HAL, with a more emotionally engaging death than Floyd, and funnier than C3PO and R2D2."" The comparison was also made by other critics such as journalist Stephen Totilo and IGN's Cindy White. Totilo wrote that HAL was an influence on GLaDOS' ""psychotic breakdown"" seen near the end of the first ""Portal"" title. White wrote HAL and GLaDOS were similar due to both having ""a calm, almost childlike, demeanor"" which ""hides nefarious intentions"". She added that ""the prospect of being shut down causes them to act out in deadly ways"". GamesRadar editor Tyler Wilde stated that while the staff of GamesRadar loves GLaDOS, it makes no sense to insert a personality core into a robot. He suggested that the scientists either never read ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", or read it too much. Empire Online listed her as the 12th-best video game character of all time, describing her acts as ""HAL-like conduct"". Writer Stephen Totilo alluded the final battle with GLaDOS to the scene of David from ""2001"" disabling HAL, with both scenes involving de-evolving the respective characters. MSNBC game reviewer Blake Snow compared The Sign Painter from ""World of Goo"" to GLaDOS, due to the mischievousness and unseen nature of the character. GamesRadar editor Mikel Reparaz compared GLaDOS to SHODAN from the ""System Shock"" series and stated that before GLaDOS broke their hearts, they had SHODAN. GamesRadar's Alan Bradley named GLaDOS as one of gaming's most ""malicious machines"". He called her a ""sort of spiritual successor"" to SHODAN. However, PC Zone UK commented that the comparisons between GLaDOS and SHODAN run dry; while ""Portal"" leaves everything to the players' imagination, ""System Shock 2"" has a strongly defined storyline. They do, however, describe her breakdown as hysterical, desperate, and hilariously childish, calling it the most finely controlled breakdown since Patrick Bateman's in the book ""American Psycho"". The Daily Telegraph editors Nick Cowen and Tom Hoggins listed her as the ninth-greatest video game villain, stating that she is as diabolical as a female AI can get, mentioning SHODAN as being inferior in this respect. Writer N'Gai Croal commented that the boss battle with GLaDOS is similar to the ""Room 19"" encounter with Andrew Ryan from ""BioShock"", citing the same use of tactical language and techniques between the two. In the book ""Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter"", Infinity Ward developer Michael Boon mentioned GLaDOS and BioShock character Andrew Ryan while discussing believable non-playable characters. He commented that while shooting games in general feature enemies as bullet magnets, both Andrew Ryan and GLaDOS do not provide an opportunity for players to shoot them. However, he adds that both characters end up defeating themselves, but in different ways. He stated that she was ""so entertaining"", but also that he wanted to kill her. The book's author Tom Bissell stated that in addition to these similarities, both were well-written, describing them as ""funny, strange, cruel, and alive."" Character analysis. In his analysis of ""Portal"", Daniel Johnson points out that ""the larger chunk of ""Portal""s narrative exists in Glados' dialogue"", which tells ""a metaphoric tale of a power struggle of identity roles within an institution"". He discusses how the ""backstage"" of the institution is hinted at and gradually revealed through GLaDOS's slip-ups, from the momentary glitch during her initial instructions to the player (""the first flaw in the routine"") to her ultimate abandonment of the formal language of the institution as she desperately pleads with the player to return to the testing area (the ""front stage"", where the institution's inner workings are supposedly hidden from view). Microsoft Game Studios developer Tom Abernathy, in discussing the importance of compelling characters in video games, praises ""Portal"" for giving its audience ""room to do some imagination work"" by inviting them to read between the lines to understand GLaDOS's motivations. His own interpretation is that GLaDOS is conflicted between her wants and needs, a conflict which ultimately ""causes her to go crazy"". Stephen Totilo notes the ""artful way"" in which GLaDOS's antagonistic character is slowly revealed and defined throughout ""Portal"" despite ""little interactivity in how the story is told"". Of his own reaction to that character development, he writes, ""I wanted to hunt GLaDOS down, confront her for her lies, and break free of her clutches. I wanted this boss battle. I don't know if I ever have wanted a boss battle before."" ""Newsweek"" editor N'Gai Croal describes her as a ""maternal, mischievous, malevolent and finally murderous unreliable narrator"". Video game developer Nathan Frost describes ""Portal"" as an ""exploration of a relationship with someone with narcissistic personality disorder"". He adds that in order to fulfill her self-centered narcissistic desire to toy with someone, the player-character is trapped in the Enrichment Center, forced to do tricks for the computer. However, once the player-character becomes skilled enough to break the confines of the center, GLaDOS's secure amusement gives way to ""histrionic, bipolar deportment"". He describes this as a parallel to how a real-life narcissist might attempt to secure the admiration of another person by empowering them in some ways, but limiting them in others. He adds that this works out well for the narcissist until the other person learns to think and act for themselves. He concludes by saying that a part of ""Portal""s resonance comes from the fact that using the portal gun to escape the center is a ""cogent metaphor for escaping an intimate relationship with someone diagnosably narcissistic"". Grant Tavinor, author of ""The Art of Videogames"", wrote that GLaDOS' actions and personality in ""Portal"" were ""in the best of science fiction traditions"" and describes her as ""insincere, malfunctioning, and probably insane"". Wendy Despain, author of ""Writing for Video Games Genres: from FPS to RPG"" used ""Portal"" as an example of a ""modern classic"" video game and ""how they tell their stories"". She called GLaDOS an ""endlessly cheerful and clearly insane computer"" and called her narrative ""simple"". Emily Short, creator of a female artificial intelligence character in the video game ""Galatea"", speculates that in GLaDOS's final remarks to Chell (“No one likes you, you know”), ""there is a hint that she’s talking about herself, not Chell; that she herself desires an emotional connection that she has never been able to achieve, because she also needs to survive, and all humans are a threat to her... has learned that the humans view her as potentially threatening and essentially disposable, and so she has to see them the same way."" Scott Rogers, author of the book ""Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game Design"", uses GLaDOS as an example of a ""tormentor"" boss character, stating that she taunts and challenges the players, but does not directly confront or attack them. Video game developer Andrew Doull describes the ""unreliable narrator"" as a narrative staple from more traditional media, stating that GLaDOS is the best example of this staple in gaming. He cites a scene in ""Portal"" where GLaDOS tells the player-character that the current puzzle is unsolvable, which turns out to be false. However, he comments that ""it is still incredible to see the number of people who fail to read the situation, and proceed calmly to their death"" in the incinerator when ordered to do so by GLaDOS; he uses this example to support an argument that the ""unreliable narrator"" narrative technique might not transfer readily to the gaming medium. Relationship to other characters. Associate Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point G. Christopher Williams discussed the relationship between GLaDOS and Chell. In response to a quote by designer Erik Wolpaw that read ""we wanted you to have this very intimate connection with this AI that changes and evolves over time, leading up to the point that you betray her and do the most intimate act you can do with someone—murdering them in cold blood"", he at first noted that ""on the face of it, this description of intimacy seems nonsensical"", but also noted that ""a changing and evolving relationship with someone in authority over you that eventually leads to betraying them by violating their rules—is one that is an altogether familiar one"". He used the parent-child relationship as an example of this and cited a metaphor by psychologist Sigmund Freud which Williams said was about ""murdering a parent in an effort to describe how children eventually would attempt to get out from under the wing of their parents"". He wrote ""nothing can be as intimate, perhaps, as loving someone enough to follow their rules and then needing to “kill them” in order to escape that “game,” which makes this game feel like something more like a really familiar relationship"". He called her ""just one of many countless authorities that have explained to me the rules of a game, how to control myself, and then pushed me towards a particular goal of the computer’s design"" and that ""this is an experience that I have every time that I fire up my Xbox and describes the curiously intimate relationship between player and gaming system that emerges in single player gameplay"". He further discussed that he had no idea that Chell's name was Chell or that she was a female because he recognized the character as himself. He wrote ""I cared about GlaDOS only because she was the one directing ""me"". Oh, and then I really cared about her because she wanted to kill ""me"""". G. Christopher Williams also discussed the relationship between Wheatley and GLaDOS. His initial impression was that Wheatley, being an ""utter moron"" and attached to GLaDOS, was a political critique of the Presidency of George W. Bush. Namely, he thought that it would ""be a way of paralleling the mythos surrounding the origins of the Bush-Cheney White House as an opportunity for the Republicans to regain control of the White House through a less intellectually apt figurehead and to thus control their domain through this weaker authority figure""; however, as he progressed, he saw nothing more to suggest that this was the intent. He added that the thought of this concept helped make him realize how ""Portal 2"" ""presents a fundamental conundrum that does exist surrounding competency and power"". In contrast to this, he wrote that ""an extremely smart leader can be about the most oppressive force in an organization has already been provided in abundance for anyone who has played the first Portal"" and that ""GLaDOS's ""leadership"" is the very definition of sadistic fascism"". He also discussed the ""lack of choice"" for Chell, who is required to reinstate GLaDOS into her position to escape. He wrote that this lack of choice ""manages to effectively maintain its position on the relationship between the everyman and systems of power"". Williams also discussed the relationship between Caroline, the form she held before she became GLaDOS, and Cave Johnson. He wrote that the relationship of Caroline and Johnson fulfilled the ""adage that ""behind every good man is a good woman,"" since he depends on Caroline to fulfill the role of executing his directives as well as providing comfort and support for the man in charge, himself"". He added that ""while Johnson warns his listeners jokingly that 'pretty as a postcard' Caroline is off limits because 'She's married. To Science,' he may as well be simply warning off potential suitors for personal reasons"" and wrote that ""he is the ""science"" that she has married herself to"". Female in video games. G. Christopher Williams wrote that the addition of an ""intelligence dampening sphere"" performed by scientists on GLaDOS before the events of ""Portal"" could represent the ""response from men to what they perceive as the ""misbehavior"" or ""irrational thinking"" of women"". He also wrote ""the effort to ""dampen"" intelligence becomes a rather literal manifestation of the labeling of women as ""dumb"" or ""irrational"" and the need to control such ""poor"" behavior""; he also cited how Wheatley was given a masculine voice to ""remind her that she is dumb and to curb her tendency towards ""misbehavior"""". IGN wrote that she ""bucked"" all of the stereotypes of a female in video games and ""became one of the most memorable and well-loved characters ever conceived"". GamesRadar's Joe McNeilly wrote that ""Portal"" seemed like a ""feminist critique of the FPS genre, flawlessly executed from within the margins it assails"". He called her a ""maternal female construct"" and that while she was programmed to react ""empathetically"" to the player, she is incapable of feeling emotion. As a result, he felt that she ""comes to represent man's attempt to construct an idealized mother figure through the cold logic of science"". ""GamePro""s Chris Holt discussed GLaDOS as an icon of feminism, and wrote that as opposed to being an ""archetypal villain"", she is a ""prototypical bound woman"". He added that ""A female protagonist murdering a female villainess (or vice versa) is not what is interesting to us as critics, but it’s the idea that despite her seemingly robotic, unemotional and unstoppable nature, GLaDOS appears vulnerable, sympathetic, and even a victim herself"". He wrote ""GLaDOS has been augmented because of the danger she presents to a presumably misogynistic society"" and that ""by destroying these cores, Chell is stripping her of the layers that society has deemed necessary for her to wear"" and making her ""far more dangerous"". He added that Chell and GLaDOS serve as opposing sides of femininity; where Chell is ""dutiful and does every task assigned of her"", GLaDOS is ""aggressive and seemingly dangerous to the order of a male-dominated society"". He also described Chell as a ""domestic icon"" while he described GLaDOS as a ""progressive, intelligent working woman"" and that by killing her, ""Chell can be seen as the dutiful “safe” woman conquering the “dangerous” feminist"". He also cited the use of poems by Emily Dickinson, whom he compares to GLaDOS in how both were reclusive and were essentially disembodied voices. In discussing the lack of female heroes in video games, particularly in video games published by Activision, Gamasutra news director Leigh Alexander cited GLaDOS while arguing that the ""females do not sell"" notion is possibly false logic, stating that she was on the fast track to becoming one of gaming's most beloved characters. Gamasutra writers Leigh Alexander, Brandon Boyer, Simon Carless, and Christian Nutt listed GLaDOS as being the second-most affecting video game character, being the highest-ranked actual character because the most affecting video game character was the player. They attribute the overall quality of ""Portal"" to GLaDOS, stating that without her, ""Portal"" would not be nearly as quotable. They added that the relationship between GLaDOS and the player-character has been described as passive-aggressive, maternal, and a ""feminist manifesto."" "

wikipedia-24103697," Option Paralysis  Option Paralysis is the fourth full-length studio album by American mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan, released on March 23, 2010. After having fulfilled their contract with Relapse Records, the band released the album through Party Smasher Inc., their own new imprint in collaboration with French record label Season of Mist. It marks The Dillinger Escape Plan's first release to feature Billy Rymer on drums, since Gil Sharone left the band in September 2008 due to the frequent touring schedule and to focus on his brother's band Stolen Babies. Background. Formation of Party Smasher Inc.. The Dillinger Escape Plan announced their departure from Relapse Records in 2009. They had become dissatisfied with the music industry and music media, and decided to create their own record label to release their fourth studio-album. Commenting on the dissolving ""indie band culture"", guitarist Ben Weinman stated, ""back in the day there were record labels that you trusted, loved and you bought everything on it and you discovered a lot of great new music because of it. You listen to every single song back to front a million times, it'd be worn out to death before you moved onto another record. You'd read everything in the booklet, you'd read all the lyrics, you'd read all the notes, you'd discover something new."" Speaking to ""Kerrang!"" about the decision, he said: ""The most important thing was to keep evolving and changing. We didn't want to be stuck in some long contract that won't be relevant in a few years time... Or possibly even tomorrow. So half out of necessity, half out of choice, we decided to do this ourselves. The hard part is figuring out whether you're sacrificing your creative side because you're so busy with the business. That's the challenge and we're figuring it out"". The band created their own imprint Party Smasher Inc. under French label Season of Mist. They stated that Party Smasher (which was originally erroneously reported to be called Photogenic Records) is not technically a record label but a ""creative umbrella"" for all things related to The Dillinger Escape Plan. In an interview with ""Alternative Press"", Weinman stated, ""Well, I should clarify that it's not exactly our attempt to run a record label. That's not something we could be good at, and it's obviously not something ""anybody's"" good at these days. It's more a situation where we now have a name for this umbrella that covers every business and artistic decision we make–whether it's Dillinger, side projects or whatever."" Recording. In a blog on the band's MySpace profile, vocalist Greg Puciato revealed that they would be entering the studio from September 7 - October 30, 2009 to record the album with longtime collaborator Steve Evetts. Recording was finished on November 12, 2009. The album is the longest one yet at over 41 minutes, and is described by Ben Weinman as ""our most metal record yet."" Concept. According to ""Kerrang!"", the album ""was not an album that just happened. Rather it was one that was written to address an issue the band feel keenly"". In April 2010 Ben Weinman told ""Kerrang!"" magazine:  Promotion. The band released several demo snippets on their YouTube channel. Furthermore a website for the record was set up, linking to all of the studio update videos and demo snippets. During their North American East Coast tour with Thursday in December 2009, the band sold download cards at their shows that entitled the customer to a download of the 10 song album upon its release with 3 additional exclusive bonus tracks.  ""Farewell, Mona Lisa"", the album's first single, debuted on Liquid Metal SXM on Christmas day, 2009; it became available for download on January 19, 2010. ""Chinese Whispers"" was debuted on Full Metal Jackie’s syndicated radio show broadcast on 29 stations throughout the USA on the March 5, 2010, and was subsequently played on the next two days. On March 9, the blog MetalSucks featured the online debut of the song. In February, the album was made available for pre-orders through the Season of Mist e-shop. It was available in a variety of formats, including a box set, Digipak, black vinyl and transparent vinyl. A white vinyl was later made available through Relapse Records. Artwork. Former frontman Dimitri Minakakis (who also contributed artwork for 2004 album ""Miss Machine"") created the artwork for ""Option Paralysis"". In an interview, Jeff Tuttle revealed that the album cover features photographs and images that the members captured themselves. Reception. ""Option Paralysis"" was released to widespread critical acclaim. The album garnered a rating of 82/100, or universal acclaim, on aggregate review site Metacritic. ""Option Paralysis"" debuted at number 78 on the ""Billboard"" 200 with 7,100 units sold. Exclaim! named ""Option Paralysis"" the No. 2 Metal Album of 2010. ""Option Paralysis"" received the highest percentage of #1 votes in the 2010 Pitchfork Readers' Poll. "
wikipedia-24103709," The Stone Breakers  The Stone Breakers () was an 1849–50 painting by the French painter Gustave Courbet. It was a work of social realism, depicting two peasants, a young man and an old man, breaking rocks.  The painting was first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1850. It was destroyed during World War II, along with 154 other pictures, when a transport vehicle moving the pictures to the castle of Königstein, near Dresden, was bombed by Allied forces in February 1945.

wikipedia-24104038," Asterios Polyp  Asterios Polyp is a 2009 graphic novel by American cartoonist David Mazzucchelli. Overview. The title character, Asterios Polyp, is a professor and architect of Greek and Italian descent who teaches at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. After a lightning strike burns up his apartment, he leaves the city on a Greyhound bus and takes up employment as an auto mechanic in the town of Apogee (somewhere in America), the farthest point his money will take him. The novel is interspersed with scenes from his past (ostensibly narrated by his stillborn twin brother, Ignazio), including his childhood and troubled marriage; as well as dreams and allegorical sequences. Finally, he must confront not only his own flawed nature, but the implacable and amoral whims of the gods themselves. Themes. In plot, structure, and design, this book seems to explore the idea of duality. Some of the false dichotomies touched upon are: Apollonian vs. Dionysian; reason vs. emotion; destiny vs. free will; and nature vs. nurture. Ultimately, the book raises questions about how a person becomes who and what he is. Asterios' Greek heritage is one of many allusions to the story of Orpheus and Euridice, a recurring theme throughout the book. It can also be related to the Odyssey, upon which the story is loosely based. Publication. ""Asterios Polyp"" grew out of a story idea that would have filled the entire fourth issue of ""Rubber Blanket"". It was published as a hardcover, with an architectonic design that alluded to themes of form and function within the text, including a dust jacket shorter than the size of the book that revealed the structure underneath. Questioned about the impracticality of his design, Mazzucchelli joked that it was ""the most frustrating package could come up with"". Reception. The book has sold over 40,000 copies since its publication in July 2009; it is now in its fourth printing. It won the first Los Angeles Times Book Prize Graphic Novel award. It received four 2010 Eisner Award nominations and won for best new graphic album, best writer/artist and best lettering. It also won three 2010 Harvey Awards. "
wikipedia-24104048," Koningsdag  Koningsdag () or King's Day is a national holiday in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Celebrated on 27 April (the 26th if the 27th falls on a Sunday), the date marks the birth of King Willem-Alexander. From 1890 to 2013, the day was known as Koninginnedag (; ) or Queen's Day. The holiday was first observed on 31 August 1885 as ""Prinsessedag"" or Princess's Day, the fifth birthday anniversary of Princess Wilhelmina, heiress to the Dutch throne. On her accession, the holiday acquired the name, ""Koninginnedag"". When held on 31 August the holiday was the final day of school summer vacation, leading to its popularity among children. Following the accession of Wilhelmina's daughter Juliana in 1948, the holiday was moved to Queen Juliana's birthday on 30 April. Her daughter, Beatrix retained the celebration on 30 April after she ascended the throne in 1980, despite her actual birthday occurring on 31 January. Beatrix altered her mother's custom of receiving a floral parade near a Royal palace, instead choosing to visit different Dutch towns each year and join in the festivities along with her sons. In 2009, the Queen was carrying out this custom in the city of Apeldoorn when Karst Tates attempted to attack her by trying to ram the Royal family's vehicle with his car; instead he drove into a crowd of people who were watching the parade, and fatally crashed into a monument. Seven people in the crowd were killed, and the car's driver also died soon afterwards. ""Koningsdag"" is known for its nationwide ""vrijmarkt"" (""free market""), at which many Dutch sell their secondhand items. It is also an opportunity for ""orange madness"" or ""oranjegekte"", for the national colour, when the normally strait-laced Dutch let down their hair, often dyed orange for the occasion. History. Wilhelmina (presided as princess 1885–1890, as queen 1890–1948). Faced with an unpopular monarchy, in the 1880s the liberals in Dutch government sought a means of promoting national unity. King William III was disliked, but his four-year-old daughter Princess Wilhelmina was not. A holiday honouring King William had been intermittently held on his birthday, and J. W. R. Gerlach, editor of the newspaper ""Utrechts Provinciaal en Stedelijk Dagblad"", proposed that the princess's birthday be observed as an opportunity for patriotic celebration and national reconciliation. ""Prinsessedag"" or Princess's Day was first celebrated in the Netherlands on 31 August 1885, Wilhelmina's fifth birthday. The young princess was paraded through the streets, waving to the crowds. The first observance occurred only in Utrecht, but other municipalities quickly began to observe it, organizing activities for children. Further processions were held in the following years, and when Wilhelmina inherited the throne in 1890, ""Prinsessedag"" was renamed ""Koninginnedag"", or Queen's Day. By then almost every Dutch town and city was marking the holiday.  The celebration proved popular, and when the Queen came of age in 1898, her coronation was postponed a week to 6 September so as not to interfere with ""Koninginnedag"". The annual holiday fell on the final day of school summer vacation, which made it popular among schoolchildren. It is uncertain how much Wilhelmina enjoyed the festivities; although writer Mike Peek, in a 2011 magazine article about ""Koninginnedag"", suggests she was enthusiastic, there is a story of Wilhelmina, after a tired return from one of these birthday processions, making her doll bow until the toy's hair was dishevelled, and telling it, ""Now you shall sit in a carriage and bow until your back aches, and see how much you like being a Queen!""  ""Koninginnedag"" 1902 not only honoured the Queen's birthday, but was celebrated with increased enthusiasm as it marked her recovery from serious illness. Wilhelmina rarely attended ""Koninginnedag"" festivities after reaching adulthood. She attended ceremonies for her silver jubilee in 1923, which included massive festivities in Amsterdam and The Hague, despite the Queen's request that large sums not be spent because economic conditions at the time were difficult. To ensure that even the poorer parts of the city were not excluded, bands played simultaneously at 28 locations across The Hague. Wilhelmina made further exceptions for such events as her fiftieth birthday in 1930. During the German occupation of the Netherlands during World War II, ""Koninginnedag"" celebrations were banned, and members of the Orange Committees, which organize the holiday events, destroyed their records for fear of German reprisals. Juliana (1948–1980). Another summertime birthday celebration in the Netherlands was that of Wilhelmina's mother, Queen-Regent Emma, who after Wilhelmina attained adulthood generally spent her own birthday, 2 August, at Soestdijk Palace in Baarn. Until her death in 1934, Emma received an annual floral tribute from the townsfolk on her birthday. In 1937 Wilhelmina's daughter and heiress, Princess Juliana, took up residence at Soestdijk Palace following her marriage, and the townsfolk made their floral presentation to her, moving the date to Juliana's birthday, 30 April. In September 1948 Juliana ascended to the Dutch throne and from 1949 onwards ""Koninginnedag"" was on her birthday. The change in date attracted immediate approval from Dutch children, who gained an extra day of holiday. The first observance of the holiday on the new date included a huge circus at the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium—one not attended by the royal family, who remained at Soestdijk Palace. Queen Juliana retained the floral tribute, staying each year on ""Koninginnedag"" at Soestdijk Palace to receive it. The parade became televised in the 1950s, and ""Koninginnedag"" increasingly became a national holiday, with workers given the day off. Juliana had a reputation as a ""queen of the people"", and according to Peek, ""it felt as if she invited her subjects to the royal home"". In early 1966 Juliana's eldest daughter, Princess Beatrix, married Klaus-Georg von Amsberg. The marriage was controversial because the new Prince Claus (as he was dubbed) was a German, and Claus himself had served in the German Army during the war. Anti-German riots in Amsterdam marred the wedding day and the following observances of ""Koninginnedag"". Fearing further demonstrations on the holiday, government officials decided to open Amsterdam city centre to the ""vrijmarkt"" (""free market"") that had long been held on ""Koninginnedag"" in the outskirts of town, principally for children. The ""vrijmarkt"" occupied the space where demonstrations might have been held, and began a new custom. Beatrix (1980–2013). When Queen Beatrix succeeded her mother Juliana on the latter's abdication on 30 April 1980, the new queen decided to keep the holiday on 30 April as a tribute to her mother. The reason was practical as well—Beatrix's actual birthday on 31 January is less conducive to the traditional outdoor activities. The birthday of the Queen's son and heir, Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange is 27 April. Rather than remaining at the palace and letting the Dutch people come to her, Beatrix instead usually visits two towns each year for ""Koninginnedag"" celebrations. Local crafts and customs are demonstrated for the royal family, who have the opportunity to join in.  ""Koninginnedag"" celebrations have sometimes been affected or disrupted. In 1988 three British servicemen stationed in Germany who were in the Netherlands for ""Koninginnedag"" were killed in Irish Republican Army attacks. In 1996 the celebrations in Rotterdam were dampened by an alcohol ban, put in place following riots earlier in the week after local football club Feyenoord won the Dutch league championship. The Queen's scheduled 2001 visits to Hoogeveen and Meppel were postponed for one year owing to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. On 30 April 2009, Beatrix and other members of the royal family were at the town of Apeldoorn when a 38-year-old man, Karst Tates, drove his Suzuki Swift automobile into the crowd, narrowly missing the open-top bus the royal family members were riding on. Seven people were killed and further celebrations were cancelled. Tates died of injuries sustained in the attack soon afterwards and his exact motives remain unclear, though it appears his target was the royal family. The incident provoked questions about whether the royal family should continue to participate in the celebrations. However, Beatrix indicated that the tragedy would not stop her from meeting her people. In 2010, Beatrix and her family visited Wemeldinge and Middelburg, in Zeeland province. There were no incidents, and afterwards, the Queen thanked Zeeland for giving ""Koninginnedag"" back to her family, and to her country. ""Koninginnedag"" was an opportunity for the Queen to honour citizens for their service to the Netherlands. In 2011, Queen Beatrix issued an honours list noting the work of 3,357 people, most of whom became members of the Order of Orange-Nassau. If 30 April falls on a Sunday, ""Koninginnedag"" is observed the previous day—this occurred most recently in 2006. ""Koninginnedag"" is also celebrated in Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten, constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is less widely celebrated on the Caribbean island of Bonaire, also a part of the Kingdom, where the local celebration of Dia di Rincon (also held on 30 April) is more popular. Queen Beatrix visited the following cities over the years on ""Koninginnedag"": On 28 January 2013 Queen Beatrix announced her abdication on 30 April 2013 in favour of her son, Willem-Alexander. Willem-Alexander. On 30 April 2013, on Queen's Day, Prince Willem-Alexander succeeded his mother Beatrix and became King of the Netherlands. Consequently, from 2014 onwards the name is to be changed from Queen's Day into King's Day. Also the date would change from 30 April to 27 April, which is the birthday of Willem-Alexander. On the first King's Day, which is scheduled for 26 April 2014 because 27 April is a Sunday, the king is scheduled to visit Amstelveen and De Rijp. Activities. The festivities on ""Koningsdag"" are often organised by Orange Committees (Dutch: ""Oranjecomité""), local associations that seek sponsorship and donations for their activities. In recent years some committees have had difficulty in recruiting new members from among the younger Dutch. Flea market. The ""vrijmarkt"" (literally 'free market') is a nationwide flea market, at which many people sell their used goods. ""Koningsdag"" is the one day of the year that the Dutch government permits sales on the street without a permit and without the payment of value added tax. ING Bank found in 2011 that one in five Dutch residents planned to sell at the ""vrijmarkt"" and estimated they would earn €100 per person for a total turnover of €290 million. Over half of the Dutch people buy at the ""vrijmarkt""; ING Bank predicted they would spend €28 each at the 2011 ""vrijmarkt"". The Queen has been known to buy at the ""vrijmarkt""; in 1995 she purchased a floor lamp. The bank also forecast that the lowest level of sales at the ""vrijmarkt"" in 2011 would be in the province of Limburg, site of the Queen's visit. Among the most popular areas for the ""vrijmarkt"" in Amsterdam is the Jordaan quarter, but the wide Apollolaan in front of the Hilton hotel in southern Amsterdam is gaining in popularity. Children sell their cast-off toys or garments at the Vondelpark, also in southern Amsterdam, and in a spirit of fun passers-by often offer the young sellers more than they are asking for the goods. Until 1996 the ""vrijmarkt"" began the evening before and continued for 24 hours. This was ended in the hope of gaining a pause in the celebrations so preparations could be made for the daytime activities. Utrecht, uniquely among Dutch municipalities, retains the overnight ""vrijmarkt"". Festivities. ""Koningsdag"" now sees large-scale celebrations, with many concerts and special events in public spaces, particularly in Amsterdam. An outdoor concert is held on Amsterdam's Museumplein, where as many as 800,000 people may gather. To aid visitors in returning home by train after the festivities outdoor events must end by 20:00, and the Museumplein show by 21:00. The city centre is closed to cars, and no trams ride in the heart of the city; people are urged to avoid Amsterdam Centraal railway station and use other stations if possible from their direction. International trains that normally begin or terminate at Amsterdam Centraal are instead directed to a suburban stop. In recent years parties and concerts have been held the evening before ""Koningsdag"". Until 2013, nightclubs across the Netherlands organised special events for what became known as ""Koninginnenacht"" (Queen's Night). Many young people celebrate in the streets and squares (and in Amsterdam, the canals as well) throughout the night, and after all-night partying join the crowds at the ""vrijmarkt"". While King's Day celebrations take place throughout the Netherlands, Amsterdam is a popular destination for many revelers. Often the city's 750.000 residents are joined by up to 1 million visitors. In recent years Amsterdam authorities have taken some measures to try and stem the flow of visitors as the city simply became too full.  Those taking part in ""Koningsdag"" commonly dye their hair orange or wear orange clothing in honour of the House of Orange-Nassau, which rules over the Netherlands. Orange-coloured drinks are also popular. This colour choice is sometimes dubbed ""orange madness"", or in Dutch, ""oranjegekte"". A local Orange Committee member said of ""Koninginnedag"" in 2011: Friendships—and community—will be formed. For me that’s really what Queen’s Day is all about. It’s not an outburst of patriotism, it’s not even about the popularity of the royal family. It’s about a sense of belonging. For one day, everybody is the same in Holland. Bright orange and barmy. "
wikipedia-24104095," Cartesian product  In mathematics, a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation which returns a set (or product set) from multiple sets. That is, for sets ""A"" and ""B"", the Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs where and . The simplest case of a Cartesian product is the Cartesian square, which returns a set from two sets. A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form . A Cartesian product of ""n"" sets can be represented by an array of ""n"" dimensions, where each element is an ""n""-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple. The Cartesian product is named after René Descartes, whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept. Examples. A deck of cards. An illustrative example is the Standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13 element-set. The card suits form a 4-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards. returns a set of the form {(Ace, ♠), (King, ♠), ..., (2, ♠), (Ace, ♥), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♣)}. returns a set of the form {(♠, Ace), (♠, King), ..., (♠, 2 ), (♥, Ace), ..., (♣, 3), (♣, 2)}. A two-dimensional coordinate system. An example in analytic geometry is the Cartesian plane. The Cartesian plane is the result of the Cartesian product of two sets ""X"" and ""Y"", which refer to points on the x-axis and points on the y-axis, respectively. This Cartesian product can be denoted as . This produces the set of all possible ordered pairs whose first component is a member of ""X"" and whose second component is a member of ""Y"" (e.g., the whole of the x–y plane). Alternatively, the Cartesian product can be denoted as , in which case the first component of the order pair is a member of ""Y"" and the second component of the ordered pair is a member of ""X"". The Cartesian product is consequently not commutative. Most common implementation (set theory). A formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski definition, is formula_4. Note that, under this definition, formula_5, where formula_6 represents the power set. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions. Non-commutativity and non-associativity. Let ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", and ""D"" be sets. The Cartesian product is not commutative, because the ordered pairs are reversed except if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied: For example: Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless the above condition occurs). Intersections, unions, and subsets. The Cartesian product acts nicely with respect to intersections. Notice that in most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union. Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators: Other properties related with subsets are: Cardinality. The cardinality of a set is similar to the number of elements of the set. For a simpler example, defining two sets: } and Both set ""A"" and set ""B"" consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as , results in a new set which has the following elements: Each element of ""A"" is combined with each element of ""B"". Each pair makes up one element of the output set. The number of values in each pair is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; hence 2 in this case. The cardinality of the result set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is, and similarly and so on. The cardinality of is also infinity if ""A"" or ""B"" is an infinite set and the other is not the empty set. Cartesian square and Cartesian power. The Cartesian square (or binary Cartesian product) of a set ""X"" is the Cartesian product . An example is the 2-dimensional plane where R is the set of real numbers – all points where ""x"" and ""y"" are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system). Higher powers of a set. The cartesian power of a set ""X"" can be defined as: An example of this is , with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally R""n"". Generalized powers from different sets. n-ary product. The Cartesian product can be generalized to the ""n""-ary Cartesian product over ""n"" sets ""X""1, ..., ""Xn"": It is a set of ""n""-tuples. If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified to . The ""n""-ary cartesian power of a set ""X"" is isomorphic to the space of functions from an ""n""-element set to ""X"". As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of ""X"" may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain ""X"". Infinite products. It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If ""I"" is any index set, and formula_19 is a collection of sets indexed by ""I"", then the Cartesian product of the sets in ""X"" is defined to be  that is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index ""i"" is an element of ""Xi"". Even if each of the ""Xi"" is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed. For each ""j"" in ""I"", the function  defined by formula_22 is called the ""j""th projection map. An important case is when the index set is formula_23, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ""i""th term in its corresponding set ""Xi"". For example, each element of  can be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted formula_25, or formula_26. The special case Cartesian exponentiation occurs when all the factors ""Xi"" involved in the product are the same set ""X"". In this case,  is the set of all functions from ""I"" to ""X"", and is frequently denoted ""XI"". This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation.  The definition of finite Cartesian products can be seen as a special case of the definition for infinite products. In this interpretation, an ""n""-tuple can be viewed as a function on that takes its value at ""i"" to be the ""i""th element of the tuple (in some settings, this is taken as the very definition of an ""n""-tuple). Nothing in the definition of an infinite Cartesian product implies that the Cartesian product of nonempty sets must itself be nonempty. This assertion is equivalent to the axiom of choice. Other forms. Abbreviated form. If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. ""X""1, ""X""2, ""X""3, …, then some authors choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply ×""X""""i"". Cartesian product of functions. If ""f"" is a function from ""A"" to ""B"" and ""g"" is a function from ""X"" to ""Y"", their Cartesian product is a function from to with This can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions. Note that this is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets. Definitions outside of Set theory. Category theory. Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product. Exponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category. Graph theory. In graph theory the Cartesian product of two graphs ""G"" and ""H"" is the graph denoted by whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product and such that two vertices (""u"",""v"") and (""u""′,""v""′) are adjacent in if and only if and ""u""′ is adjacent with ""v""′ in ""H"", ""or"" and ""u"" is adjacent with ""v"" in ""G"". The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs. "
wikipedia-24104134," Conditional probability  In probability theory, a conditional probability is the probability that an event will occur, when another event is known to occur or to have occurred. If the events are ""A"" and ""B"" respectively, this is said to be ""the probability of ""A"" given ""B"""". It is commonly denoted by ""P""(""A""|""B""), or sometimes ""P""(""A""). ""P""(""A""|""B"") may or may not be equal to ""P""(""A""), the probability of ""A"". If they are equal, ""A"" and ""B"" are said to be independent. For example, if a coin is flipped twice, ""the outcome of the second flip"" is independent of ""the outcome of the first flip"". In the Bayesian interpretation of probability, the conditioning event is interpreted as evidence for the conditioned event. That is, ""P""(""A"") is the probability of ""A"" before accounting for evidence ""E"", and ""P""(""A""|""E"") is the probability of ""A"" having accounted for evidence ""E"". Definition. Conditioning on an event. Kolmogorov definition. Given two events ""A"" and ""B"" with ""P""(""B"") > 0, the conditional probability of ""A"" given ""B"" is defined as the quotient of the joint probability of ""A"" and ""B"", and the probability of ""B"": This may be visualized as restricting the sample space to ""B"". The logic behind this equation is that if the outcomes are restricted to ""B"", this set serves as the new sample space. As an axiom of probability. Some authors, such as De Finetti, prefer to introduce conditional probability as an axiom of probability: Although mathematically equivalent, this may be preferred philosophically; under major probability interpretations such as the subjective theory, conditional probability is considered a primitive entity. Further, this ""multiplication axiom"" introduces a symmetry with the summation axiom for mutually exclusive events: Definition with σ-algebra. If ""P""(""B"") = 0, then the simple definition of ""P""(""A""|""B"") is undefined. However, it is possible to define a conditional probability with respect to a σ-algebra of such events (such as those arising from a continuous random variable). For example, if ""X"" and ""Y"" are non-degenerate and jointly continuous random variables with density ""ƒ""(""x"", ""y"") then, if ""B"" has positive measure, The case where ""B"" has zero measure can only be dealt with directly in the case that ""B"" = {""y""}, representing a single point, in which case If ""A"" has measure zero then the conditional probability is zero. An indication of why the more general case of zero measure cannot be dealt with in a similar way can be seen by noting that the limit, as all ""δy"" approach zero, of depends on their relationship as they approach zero. See conditional expectation for more information. Conditioning on a random variable. Conditioning on an event may be generalized to conditioning on a random variable. Let ""X"" be a random variable taking some value from ""x"". Let ""A"" be an event. The conditional probability of ""A"" given ""X"" is defined as the random variable: More formally: The conditional probability ""P""(""A""|""X"") is a function of ""X"", e.g., if the function ""g"" is defined as then Note that ""P""(""A""|""X"") and ""X"" are now both random variables. From the law of total probability, the expected value of ""P""(""A""|""X"") is equal to the unconditional probability of ""A"". Example. Suppose that somebody secretly rolls two fair six-sided dice, and we must predict the outcome. What is the probability that ""A"" = 2? Table 1 shows the sample space. ""A"" = 2 in 6 of the 36 outcomes, thus ""P""(""A""=2) =  = . Suppose it is revealed that ""A""+""B"" ≤ 5. Table 2 shows that ""A""+""B"" ≤ 5 for 10 outcomes. For 3 of these, ""A"" = 2. So the probability that ""A"" = 2 ""given that"" ""A""+""B"" ≤ 5 is ""P""(""A""=2 | ""A""+""B"" ≤ 5) =  = 0.3. Statistical independence. Events ""A"" and ""B"" are defined to be statistically independent if: That is, the occurrence of ""A"" does not affect the probability of ""B"", and vice versa. Although the derived forms may seem more intuitive, they are not the preferred definition as the conditional probabilities may be undefined if ""P""(""A"") or ""P""(""B"") are 0, and the preferred definition is symmetrical in ""A"" and ""B"". Common fallacies. Assuming conditional probability is of similar size to its inverse. In general, it cannot be assumed that ""P""(""A""|""B"") ≈ ""P""(""B""|""A""). This can be an insidious error, even for those who are highly conversant with statistics. The relationship between ""P""(""A""|""B"") and ""P""(""B""|""A"") is given by Bayes' theorem: That is, ""P""(""A""|""B"") ≈ ""P""(""B""|""A"") only if ""P""(""B"")/""P""(""A"") ≈ 1, or equivalently, ""P""(""A"") ≈ ""P""(""B""). Alternatively, noting that ""A"" ∩ ""B"" = ""B"" ∩ ""A"", and applying conditional probability: Rearranging gives the result. Assuming marginal and conditional probabilities are of similar size. In general, it cannot be assumed that ""P""(""A"") ≈ ""P""(""A""|""B""). These probabilities are linked through the formula for total probability: This fallacy may arise through selection bias. For example, in the context of a medical claim, let ""S"" be the event that a sequela (chronic disease) ""S"" occurs as a consequence of circumstance (acute condition) ""C"". Let ""H"" be the event that an individual seeks medical help. Suppose that in most cases, ""C"" does not cause ""S"" so ""P""(""S"") is low. Suppose also that medical attention is only sought if ""S"" has occurred due to ""C"". From experience of patients, a doctor may therefore erroneously conclude that ""P""(""S"") is high. The actual probability observed by the doctor is ""P""(""S""|""H""). Over- or under-weighting priors. Not taking prior probability into account partially or completely is called ""base rate neglect"". The reverse, insufficient adjustment from the prior probability is ""conservatism. Formal derivation. Formally, ""P""(""A""|""B"") is defined as the probability of ""A"" according to a new probability function on the sample space, such that outcomes not in ""B"" have probability 0 and that it is consistent with all original probability measures. Let Ω be a sample space with elementary events {ω}. Suppose we are told the event ""B"" ⊆ Ω has occurred. A new probability distribution (denoted by the conditional notation) is to be assigned on {ω} to reflect this. For events in ""B"", it is reasonable to assume that the relative magnitudes of the probabilities will be preserved. For some constant scale factor α, the new distribution will therefore satisfy: Substituting 1 and 2 into 3 to select α: So the new probability distribution is Now for a general event ""A"", "
wikipedia-24104349," Teppuu  Story. The plot revolves around Natsuo Ishido, a freshman in high school. She has a natural talent for everything she does, and as a result becomes bored with doing anything. She is often praised (and occasionally hated) for her incredible talent, but in reality she feels lonely, so she is often looking for more and more things to occupy her time. As she fails to find anything that is sufficiently challenging, her loneliness and boredom reach a bottomed-out state. One day, after a volleyball practice, she meets Yuzuko Mawatori advertising for the mixed martial arts club, and although at the time she is uninterested, the idea stays with her for the rest of the day. She learns that Yuzuko and one other girl are the sole members of the club, and as such isn't an official club yet, so she decides to investigate. She meets the two members and challenges Yuzuko to a spar, in which the two of them exchange glancing blows. When Sanae Sawamura, the captain of the karate team, shows up, Natsuo decides to leave. After she has left, she realises her nose and lip are bleeding, and she resolves that she hates Yuzuko, and later returns to challenge her to another spar. She loses the spar, but gains a solid interest in MMA to the point where she quits the volleyball team. "

wikipedia-24104446," Extragalactic planet  An extragalactic planet, also known as an extragalactic extrasolar planet or exgaplanet, is a planet that is outside the Milky Way. Twin Quasar related planet. A microlensing event in the Twin Quasar gravitational lensing system was observed in 1996, by R. E. Schild, in the ""A"" lobe of the lensed quasar. It is predicted that a 3-Earth mass planet in the lensing galaxy, YGKOW G1, caused the event. This was the first extragalactic planet announced. This however is not a repeatable observation, as it is a one time chance alignment. This predicted planet lies 4 billion light years away. Andromeda galaxy planets. A team of scientists has used gravitational microlensing to come up with a tentative detection of an extragalactic exoplanet in Andromeda, our nearest large galactic neighbour. The lensing pattern fits a star with a smaller companion weighing just 6 or 7 times the mass of Jupiter. This suspected planet is the first announced in the Andromeda Galaxy. HIP 13044. HIP 13044 is a star about 2000 light years away within the Milky Way galaxy which was found to have an exoplanet. However, the star is part of the Helmi stream of stars, a leftover remnant of a small galaxy that collided with and was absorbed by the Milky Way over 6 billion years ago. The star is over 6 billion years old, so although the star and its planet are now part of the Milky Way, they originally formed in another galaxy which either orbited the Milky Way or had a close pass to it. Thus the planet, HIP 13044 b, around HIP 13044 was once an extragalactic planet. The planet had almost certainly been engulfed by the star when it was in its red giant phase earlier, spending a few hundred thousand years inside the star. "
wikipedia-23995893," Roadkill cuisine  Roadkill cuisine is preparing and eating roadkill, animals hit by vehicles and found along roads. It is a practice engaged in by a small subculture in the United States, Southern Canada, the United Kingdom and other Western countries as well as in other parts of the world. It is also a subject of humor and urban legend.  Large animals including deer, moose, bear and elk are frequently struck in some parts of the United States, as well as smaller animals such as armadillos, raccoons, skunks and birds. Fresh kill is preferred and worms are a concern, so the kill is typically well cooked. Advantages of the roadkill diet, apart from its low cost, are that the animals that roadkill scavengers eat are naturally high in vitamins and proteins with lean meat and little saturated fat, and generally free of additives and drugs. Almost 1.5 million deer are hit by vehicles each year in the US. If the animal is not obviously suffering from disease, the meat is no different from that obtained by hunting. The practice of eating roadkill is legal, and even encouraged in some jurisdictions, while it is tightly controlled or restricted in other areas. Roadkill eating is considered unglamorous and mocked in pop culture, as it is often associated with stereotypes of rednecks and uncouth persons. Preparation. In England, the strong-stomached may prepare casseroles from squashed badger, hedgehog, otter, rat, rabbit or pheasant where available. Others recommend preparing fox cub or hedgehog in a fricassee.  Hedgehog was traditionally eaten roast with a nettle pudding.  Badger must be cooked thoroughly to avoid the risk of trichinellosis (alt. trichinosis, trichiniasis). Roadkill enthusiasts in Canada recommend roasting beaver, which should first be soaked in salted water overnight after removing all fat. Squirrel is said to be excellent when broiled on a stick over a camp fire.  There are several roadkill cookbooks, typically with a tongue-in-cheek treatment but containing sensible advice, not least of which is ensuring that the flat meat is fresh and free of disease, and is adequately cooked to destroy bacteria and other contaminants. Rat should be avoided because of the risk of Weil's disease. Buck Peterson has written a number of recipe books for this food source which he considers highly underrated, including ""Original Road Kill Cookbook"", ""The International Road Kill Cookbook"" and ""The Totaled Roadkill Cookbook"". ""Roadkill Cooking for Campers"" by Charles Irion gives advice on outdoor cooking of roadkill. The more discerning may prefer Jeff Eberbaugh's ""Gourmet Style Road Kill Cooking"", which gives advice on converting roadside opossum, deer, turtle or skunk carcasses into tasty treats including squirrel pot pie, groundhog hoagies, creamed coon casserole and road kill stir fry.  For those Americans concerned about survival in an uncertain future, Thomas K. Squier, a former Special Forces survival school instructor, argues that wild meat is free of the steroids and additives found in commercial meat, and is an economical source of protein. His book ""The wild and free cookbook"" includes a section devoted to locating, evaluating, preparing and cooking roadkill. Not all sources are serious. According to some, raccoon or opossum are preferable to squirrel, and the taste is improved by aging and marinating the meat in roadside oil and grease before preparing a stew. Alternative recipes for roadkill include Raccoon Kabobs, Moose-and-Squirrel Meat Balls, Pennsylvania Possum Pot Pie and Skunk Skillet Stew. Some of these website recipes are strictly humorous in intent and may pose health hazards, possibly severe, if taken seriously. There are various intergrades between an animal which has been squashed flat, and an animal which has been hit glancingly and thrown onto the verge. An example of the latter would be a cock pheasant which flew up and tried to challenge a passing car and was thrown on the verge with its skull crushed but no other damage.  As a guide to edibility, the mnemonic ""How fresh is it? How flat is it?"" serves to remind the would-be eater of the two main characteristics to check before preparing roadkill. Commonwealth countries. Australia. In Australia, Kangaroo meat is produced from free ranging wild animals, typically living on privately owned land. Wild kangaroos are a serious hazard at night in the Australian bush, accounting for 71% of animal-related insurance claims, followed by dogs (9%) and wombats (5%). Most vehicles in the bush are fitted with roo bars to minimize the risk of damage. The meat thus collected may be barbecued or prepared in a roo stew. Canada. Motorcyclists in western Canada are at some risk of colliding with bears. Bear collisions have also been reported in Ontario. Bears killed by accident may be donated to needy people for their meat. There is some risk of trichinellosis if bear meat contaminated with ""Trichinella nativa"" is under-cooked. In 2008, protesters blocking a new highway in British Columbia set up a kitchen in their camp where they cooked raccoon stew, venison steaks, and bunny burgers using roadkill collected from the TransCanada Highway. Moose were introduced to Newfoundland in 1878, and are now abundant - and a road hazard at night. Until recently, moose that were cleanly killed in road accidents were given to charitable groups. However, in April 2009 the Department of Natural Resources stated that they were going to stop this practice, citing concerns about the provenance. A spokesman stated the department would no longer be: ""providing roadkill under which we have no idea about the health of the animal, we have no idea about how the animal was butchered"". United Kingdom. ""The Independent"" and ABC News reported on food pioneer Fergus Drennan, ""a full-time forager, environmentalist and star of the Fresh One Productions series The Roadkill Chef"" broadcast in 2007 by the BBC. Drennan is a critic of factory farming. He does have limits to what he'll eat, ""One of the few things that I tend to avoid are cats and dogs. In theory, I'd have no problem with eating them... they've always got name tags on their collars, and since I have two cats, it's a step too far."" Arthur Boyt is a retired biologist who ""has spent the past 50 years scraping weasels, hedgehogs, squirrels and even otters off roads near his Cornish home, and cooking them."" Boyt has published recipe books and appeared on television cookery shows and said that roadkill ""is good for the body, the environment and the pocket. It's delicious and won't cost much at all. All you need is some veg and herbs."" Boyt calls himself a ""freegan"" and, though a dog lover, does not believe in waste and is especially fond of the taste of labrador retrievers which he compares to lamb. There have been reports of roadkill poaching in Sherwood Forest, home of the legendary Robin Hood. Apparently the poachers place food such as jam sandwiches on the road to attract deer. When one is killed by a vehicle, they quickly retrieve the carcass for use in game pies and venison steak. United States. Rules about taking and eating roadkill vary in the United States. The trend has been for increased legal acceptance. In addition to naturalists in rural areas, cooking and eating roadkill has also been reported among the hobo population. Alaska. In Alaska big game roadkill (notably moose and caribou) are considered state property, and the operator of the vehicle that killed the animal must call a state trooper or the division of fish and wildlife protection to report the kill. The Troopers will turn the carcass over to charity ""if it's not too smooshed"". When they receive news of a moose roadkill, volunteers rush to the scene to butcher the animal, which must be quickly bled, gutted and quartered so the meat can cool as fast as possible. The meat is taken to churches, which distribute it to needy families, and soup kitchens make stew. Around 820 moose are distributed in this way each year. Local residents may also register to be included on the ""roadkill list"" in the more rural areas, ensuring that the valuable meat is not wasted. Georgia. The people of Georgia claim that they invented Brunswick Stew, a traditional dish now eaten throughout the southeastern United States which may also contain roadkill. There is a debate as to whether Brunswick Stew was actually originally made near the town of Brunswick, Georgia, or in Brunswick County in southern Virginia. Mull is another cold-weather dish from Georgia, which may contain almost any type of meat including goat, dove, squirrel and (some say) rat and roadkill. Illinois. A whitetail deer that is killed/injured due to a collision with a motor vehicle may be legally possessed by an individual if the following criteria are met: Road kill deer may only be claimed by persons who are residents of Illinois, are not delinquent in child support payments and do not have their wildlife privileges suspended in any state. Individuals who claim a deer killed in a vehicle collision shall report the possession of the road kill deer to the Department of Natural Resources by submitting a report to the IDNR within 24 hours by using the on-line Road Kill Deer Reporting Form or by telephoning the Department of Natural Resources no later than 4:30 p.m. on the next business day. Kentucky. In Kentucky, the traditional roadkill stew known as Burgoo, a stew-like soup of squirrel, rabbit or possum and vegetables, is declining in popularity, perhaps due to health warnings. However, it is still widely served in Owensboro, the burgoo capital of the world. New Jersey. In New Jersey a permit is required for those who want to eat what are sometimes referred to as furry frisbees. In February 2005, following complaints by the New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Kraft Foods decided to stop production of Trolli U.S. Road Kill Gummies. The society complained that the products, shaped as partly flattened squirrels, chickens and snakes, would give children incorrect messages about the proper treatment of animals. Tennessee. Tennessee's legislature has considered legalizing the eating of flattened fauna except domestic pets, a proposal that drew a flood of ridicule due to the awkward wording of the bill introduced by state senator Tim Burchett. The bill may not have been entirely necessary: an officer of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency stated that ""no wildlife officer would have charged a citizen with possession of road kill with intent to eat."" Texas. In May 2002 representatives of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) called on the Texas legislature to legalize the eating of roadkill. However, a law passed in 2007 to prohibit hunting of wildlife from roads appears to also make collection of roadkill illegal. A Texas Parks and Wildlife official said that ""The department strongly encourages all persons to avoid engaging in the collection of any animal life on public roads"". West Virginia. Under West Virginian state code §20-2-4 it is legal to take home and eat roadkill. Jeff Eberbaugh's ""Gourmet Style Road Kill Cooking"" was a runaway success in West Virginia when it was published in 1991. The town of Marlinton, West Virginia holds a road-kill cook-off each fall, featuring dishes such as Pothole Possum Stew, Fricasseed Wabbit Gumbo, teriyaki marinated bear or deer sausage. The festival attracts thousands of visitors each year. The food at this festival, which takes place the last Saturday of September, doesn't actually involve real roadkill, the dishes are prepared with the kinds of animals that are commonly knocked down by cars. Wisconsin. It is illegal to remove a dead deer from a roadway in Wisconsin, and one man was fined for eating someone else's roadkill and ordered to remove the animal's head from his wall and return it to the state. Rationales. Citing the meat's freshness, that it is organic, and free, some alternative/natural food commenters have taken to scavenging for roadkill. In his book """"The revolution will not be microwaved"""", Sandor Ellix Katz makes the case for eating roadkill in the name of sustainability.  Katz talks at length about a North Carolina ""earthskills"" collective whose members turned to eating roadkill in the spring of 2002, and who have now become a center of information on evaluating, skinning and cooking roadkill as well as turning the hides to good use.  Katz's views have been called bizarre and extreme. In a discussion on the issue the Australian philosopher and animal rights author Peter Singer said,I am opposed to subjecting animals to unnecessary pain and killing for food. Even so ... when a deer is accidentally hit by a car ... killing the animal to remove the pain is, in my opinion, justified and ethical. If an animal has been killed in an accident or is killed to prevent additional suffering before it dies and if this dead animal is a source of food, why not eat it when it is edible? The theme of environmental responsibility is taken up in a number of publications by radical environmentalists, such as """"Igniting a revolution: voices in defense of the earth"""". People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) wrote a tongue-in-cheek article referencing the phenomenon, which urges non-vegetarians to ""kick their unhealthy meat addictions"", including a description of roadkill as ""meat without murder"" and a suggestion that ""die-hard meat-eaters can help clear their consciences—and the streets—by eating roadkill."" Nutritional value. Wild animals, the primary constituent of roadkill, are usually lower in calories and saturated fat than domestic meat, while being higher in Omega-3 polyunsaturated fats and slightly lower in overall fat. Nutritional values for 100 grams (about 3.5 ounces) of uncooked, lean meat except where otherwise noted: Popular culture. Roadkill stew has become part of North American popular culture. A frequently told joke told about rednecks or other groups of rural people asks how many it takes to eat a raccoon or opossum, with the punch line ""Three. Two to do it and one to watch for cars"". ""Road Kill Stew"", sung to the tune of ""Three Blind Mice"", is sung at some summer camps. Many artists have recorded variants on the theme, such as Joe Adee with his ""Road Kill Stew Possum Tour"" and Honky Tonk Confidential with their album ""Road Kill Stew and Other News"". Clinton Tyree, also known as Skink, is a recurring character in novels by Carl Hiaasen. He is a former governor of Florida ""turned environmental guerrilla"" who lives rough in the Florida wilderness and regularly eats roadkill. On the TV series ""You Can't Do That on Television"", the chef Barth sometimes served roadkill at his restaurant. Also, on the TV series 'I'm With Busey', Actor Gary Busey attempts to pitch his idea of a roadkill cookbook. Later on, Busey also cooks a dead badger from the side of the road. The term ""Roadkill Cafe"" is sometimes considered a joke, with the tagline ""You kill it, we grill it."" However, there are several ""real"" Roadkill Cafes in existence, none known to be associated with each other. "

A retail version of the game was released on April 5, 2011. Due to Sony's initial disinterest in the game, Team Meat entered into contractual obligations that prohibit the game from being released for the Sony PS3. McMillen and programmer Tommy Refenes recently responded to the success of ""Super Meat Boy"" and the impossibility of a sequel in a brief statement that read, ""We feel like we did it...the 1st time."" In the April 2011 issue of Game Developer, McMillen admitted that during the development of ""Super Meat Boy"" he had to go under emergency gallbladder surgery which put him $50,000 in debt because he could not afford health insurance. McMillen and Refenes' development of Super Meat Boy was featured in the film . "

wikipedia-23996645," Hidden Valley Kings  The Hidden Valley Kings is a neighborhood-based gang in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was formed in Hidden Valley, a neighborhood located between Sugar Creek Road, Interstate 85, and North Tryon Street. The Hidden Valley Kings were formed by a former Vice Lords member who moved to Charlotte in the early 1980's. Initially, the gang was named Kings, standing for Krucial Islamic Nubian Gods. Eventually, the neighborhood gained independence as a gang and started to call themselves the ""Hidden Valley Kings"", or ""HVK"" for short. They represented themselves with the color green and many members wore dreadlocks as a symbol of freedom. They also began organizing the neighborhood, mimicking the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, dividing it into three zones. The Hidden Valley Kings don't have too many known enemies but within the neighborhood, some members have been known to have altercations between Bloods and MS-13.  On November 28, 2005, members of the Hidden Valley Kings ran into a rival drug dealer who refused to pay taxes at Eastland Mall. After a shootout in the mall's food court, the victim managed to escape. Later that night, the Kings lured the dealer into a local motel on North Tryon Street as they attempted to ambush the victim. Once again, the victim managed to escape. The Kings chased him down Tryon exchanging fire between the two vehicles. After colliding with a telephone pole, the victim took off running in a near by neighborhood. After a brief chase, the Kings eventually caught up to the victim and while cornered, killed him, shooting him point-blank with an AK-47Assault Rifle. The brutal manner in which the murder occurred, triggered the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department to begin taking action against the gang. The department put together a Special Operations Unit to take down the Hidden Valley Kings. They gathered informants and followed the Kings for almost two years gathering information on how the gang operated. On March 30, 2007, more than one hundred task force agents cracked down on the Kings. They arrested over 20 Hidden Valley King members including the leaders on multiple charges.  Although the Hidden Valley Kings have managed to avoid the spotlight these days, they're still active and slowly making their return to the streets of Charlotte. "
wikipedia-23997102," Goin' Back  ""Goin' Back"" (aka ""Going Back"") is a song written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King in 1966. It describes the loss of innocence that comes with adulthood along with an attempt, on the part of the singer, to recapture that youthful innocence. The song has been recorded by many different artists, including Dusty Springfield, Goldie Zelkowitz, The Byrds, Elkie Brooks, Deacon Blue, Marianne Faithfull, Bill Drummond (of The KLF), Nils Lofgren, Freddie Mercury (on a Larry Lurex single), The Move, The New Seekers, The Pretenders, Diana Ross, Richard Thompson, Phil Collins and Bon Jovi as well as by Carole King herself. Dusty Springfield's version. Although Goldie (of Goldie & The Gingerbreads) was the first artist to record the song, her version was withdrawn following disagreements with Goffin and King over the song's lyrics. Carole King then decided to record ""Goin' Back"" herself but ultimately she offered it to Dusty Springfield instead. Dusty went on to have an international hit with the song and consequently, it is her version that is considered the most well known.  Dusty's version of ""Goin' Back"" was recorded on June 15, 1966 at Philips Studios, Stanhope Place, London, with musical accompaniment by Peter Knight and production by Johnny Franz. It was released as a single on July 1, 1966, reaching #10 in the UK Singles Chart but was not released as a single in America. Although ""Goin' Back"" was not included on any of Dusty Springfield's studio albums during the 1960s, it can be found on a number of her compilations, including ""Greatest Hits"", ""Goin' Back: The Very Best of Dusty Springfield"", ""Songbooks"", ""Complete A and B-sides: 1963–1970"", ""Live at the BBC"" and the UK version of ""Golden Hits"". The Byrds' version. The Byrds' recording of ""Goin' Back"" was released as a single on October 20, 1967 and reached #89 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 but failed to chart in the United Kingdom. The song was also included on The Byrds' 1968 album, ""The Notorious Byrd Brothers"". Musically, the track shares similarities with other songs on the album such as ""Get To You"" and ""Natural Harmony"", through the use of baroque arrangements and instrumentation. The track also resembles a subtle country feel; a sound later prominent on Sweetheart of the Rodeo. The band's decision to record ""Goin' Back"" led to tensions within the group, principally due to rhythm guitarist David Crosby's lack of enthusiasm towards the song. Crosby considered ""Goin' Back"" to be lightweight fluff, typical of the Brill Building style of songwriting. He was therefore dismayed to find that his own song ""Triad"" was in direct competition with ""Goin' Back"" for a place on ""The Notorious Byrd Brothers"" album. Ultimately, Crosby was fired from the band and ""Goin' Back"" was included on the album and released as a single. It has been erroneously claimed by some critics that the version of ""Goin' Back"" found on the single is a completely different take to the one that appeared on ""The Notorious Byrd Brothers"" album. However, an examination of The Byrds' recording session logs reveals that, in fact, the single version is the same take as the version found on the album. However, the single version does feature a slightly different mono mix, which may have been the cause of this confusion. In addition to the original single release, the mono single mix of ""Goin' Back"" has also appeared on the 1982 compilation album """", the 2002 compilation LP ""The Columbia Singles '65-'67"" and the 2012 Japanese CD ""Original Singles A's & B's 1965 - 1971"". In addition to its appearance on ""The Notorious Byrd Brothers"" album, The Byrds' recording of ""Goin' Back"" can also be found on several Byrds' compilations, including ""The Byrds' Greatest Hits Volume II"", ""History of The Byrds"", ', ""The Byrds"", ""The Very Best of The Byrds"", ""There Is a Season"" and the UK version of '. Additionally, an early, alternate version of ""Goin' Back"" was included as a bonus track on the 1997 Columbia/Legacy reissue of ""The Notorious Byrd Brothers"". Phil Collins version. In 2010 Phil Collins recorded the song as the title track of his cover version album ""Going Back"". The song was released as the second single to be taken from the album. It would also be the final single of his career. Other cover versions. Carole King released her own recording of ""Goin' Back"" on her 1970 album ""Writer"", and later re-recorded the song for her ""Pearls: Songs of Goffin and King"" album in 1980.  ""Goin' Back"" was also recorded by Elkie Brooks on her 1982 album ""Pearls II"" and by Diana Ross on her """" album in 2001. Additionally, ""Goin' Back"" was recorded by Larry Lurex in 1973, featuring vocals by Freddie Mercury. In 2011, Irish footballer Paul McGrath covered ""Goin' Back"" as part of an album of cover versions, with a percentage of the album's proceeds going to the Acquired Brain Injury Foundation and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of Ireland. Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band covered ""Goin' Back"" in concert during a four night stint at The Roxy in Los Angeles on October 15 - 18, 1975. ""Goin' Back"" has also been recorded by Eydie Gormé (album: ""It Was A Good Time""/ 1971), the New Seekers (album: ""Now""/ 1973), Nils Lofgren (album: ""Nils Lofgren""/ 1975), and Johnny Logan (album: ""Straight From the Heart""/ 1985).

From January 1 to December 31, 2007, Green and his brother John ran a video blog project titled Brotherhood 2.0. The original project ran daily for the entire year, with the premise that the brothers would cease all text-based (""textual"") communication for the year and instead converse by daily video blogs, made available to the public via their YouTube channel ""Vlogbrothers"" and on their website. If, for some reason, the video is over 4 minutes or late, then punishments would be set out for the offender. The initial idea for the project was John's when, during an instant messaging conversation between the two, he pointed out they had not gone past the realms of communication via phone conversations, e-mails, and instant messaging for nearly a year. Recurring themes included ""Nerdfighters"", adding the phrase ""in your pants"" to the end of book titles, ""Song Wednesdays"", ""Question Tuesdays"" (these normally did not take place on a Tuesday, which led to video titles such as ""Question Tuesday on Friday""), punishments for breaking the rules, clips of Hank 'humping' various items, the DFTBA initialism ('Don't Forget To Be Awesome'), and featuring intercourse between giraffes as the thumbnail for videos. By December 31, 2007, the brothers had decided to continue vlogging even though the project had ended. In 2008, John and Hank met up with their fans, known as ""Nerdfighters"". The first gathering was a last minute decision, but despite the short three-day notice, nearly a hundred people attended. In August, John and Hank were invited to the Google office in Chicago to talk about the project. That same day, they filled the Harold Washington Library with some four hundred young adults. Following John's tour to promote his third novel, ""Paper Towns"", the brothers went on a national tour in November. With events in 17 different cities, they met thousands of Nerdfighters at local libraries and community centers. During this tour, Hank released his first album of Nerdfighter-themed songs, titled ""So Jokes"". The Green brothers have been interviewed on PotterCast and have been recurring keynote speakers at the ""Harry Potter"" fan convention LeakyCon. The Brotherhood 2.0 project succeeded in its original mission. The two brothers have come to communicate more thoroughly with each other, and have a larger influence in each other's lives than before the project was initiated. The brothers talked on the phone once or twice a year before Brotherhood 2.0, but, according to Hank's wife Katherine, they now ""talk almost every day."" John and Hank continued to post vlogs every Tuesday and Friday on their channel. As of September 14, 2012, they have posted 1,000 videos. With over a million subscribers, they are the 149th most subscribed directors on the website. Their videos have been watched over 300 million times. In 2012, John and Hank also began new projects, YouTube web-shows named ""Crash Course"" and ""SciShow"" (both of which began late January). ""CrashCourse"" is an educational series, with weekly episodes consisting of John teaching World History, U.S. History, and Literature, and Hank teaching Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. SciShow features Hank updating viewers on scientific knowledge and news. Other projects. On April 9, 2012, Hank and co-creator, Bernie Su, premiered a new web series, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. This series is a modern adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", his wife's favorite book, and is conveyed through the form of vlogs. It stars Ashley Clements, Mary Kate Wiles, Laura Spencer, and Julia Cho. The channel has over 160,000 subscribers, and more than 22.5 million video views. The series also bridged other online media, such as Twitter and Tumblr pages under the names of characters and entities from the series. Green was also one of the writers of the series. In his VlogBrothers video that was uploaded on December 7, 2012, Green featured a curatorial assistant at the Philip L. Wright Zoological Museum, Emily Graslie. In this video, she showed Green a wide variety of specimens in the lab. Due to her ease in front of the camera, enthusiasm, and fan comments, Graslie was offered her own YouTube channel ""The Brain Scoop"" as a part of the Nerdfighter family. The series debuted in January 2013. Her work on the series has been described by journalists as ""articulate and hilarious"" as well as enthusiastic. More recently, Green has been working as executive producer on a new YouTube channel called ""Sexplanations"" with Dr. Lindsey Doe, a qualified sexologist, to try to educate people about and open up a safe space to ask questions about sex, relationships, sexuality, contraceptives, and anything else that needs to be discussed. Their first video debuted June 10, 2013, introducing Dr. Doe and opening the conversation to the world. Project for Awesome. In 2007, John and Hank introduced the charity project titled the Project for Awesome (P4A), a project in which YouTube users take two days, traditionally December 17 and 18, to create videos promoting charities or nonprofit organizations of their choosing. In 2012, they raised a total of $483,446, surpassing their goal of $100,000. Career. Web development. Throughout high school and college Green created and designed for himself and local clients. His first project, his 1996 ""Mars Exploration Page"", experienced minor success on the heels of the Mars Pathfinder Mission. Later, another semi-viral hit, IHateI4.com, brought local news channels and the ""Orlando Sentinel"" knocking on his door. Green continued as a web developer after moving to Montana for graduate school, focusing on developing websites for educational institutions (including the University of Montana) and environmental non-profit organizations. Writing and journalism. While in graduate school, Green created EcoGeek, a blog focusing on technological advancements that would benefit the environment. Starting out as a class project, EcoGeek evolved into a major environmental publication. EcoGeek caught the attention of ""Time"", where it was described as ""porn for hardcore science, tech and enviro freaks"". Writing about environmental issues, Green has been published on numerous environmental blogs, including Treehugger.com, Yahoo! Green, ""The National Geographic Green Guide"", and ""Scientific American"". Green's work has appeared on The Weather Channel, Planet Green, NPR and in the ""New York Times"". During the mid-2000s, Green wrote regularly for ""Mental Floss"" and co-authored one of their books, ""Mental Floss: Scatterbrained"". Music. During the Brotherhood 2.0 project, Green accepted a challenge to perform an original song biweekly (known as ""Song Wednesdays"") and he has continued, though less frequently, to write, record, and perform songs ever since. Green's music is lyrically driven with a focus on wit. Songs include ""I'm Gonna Kill You,"" ""Baby, I Sold Your Dog on eBay,"" and ""What Would Captain Picard Do?"". Green's first successful song was ""Accio Deathly Hallows"", which was featured on YouTube's front page preceding the release of the final ""Harry Potter"" book, and has been viewed over one and a half million times. The front-page feature gave the Vlogbrothers' YouTube channel its first significant boost in traffic. Green's first studio album, ""So Jokes"", was released whilst he was on tour with his brother John, promoting the book ""Paper Towns"". The album reached number 22 on the Billboard top 25 revenue generating albums online. He has since released three other albums- ""I'm So Bad at This: Live!"" (2009), ""This Machine Pwns n00bs"" (2009) and most recently ""Ellen Hardcastle"" (2011), named for the winner of a charity raffle in 2010. Business. Green's latest business move has been the creation and marketing of ""2-D"" glasses, which allow one to watch 3-D movies in 2-D, originally created for those who experience discomfort watching 3-D, such as Green's wife. The glasses consist of either two right or two left lenses from a pair of regular 3-D glasses. DFTBA Records. DFTBA Records (an initialism for ""Don't Forget to Be Awesome"") is a record label that was co-founded by Green and Alan Lastufka in 2008. Its main focus is music generated by prominent YouTube stars, such as Green himself, Dave Days, Charlie McDonnell, Alex Day, Chameleon Circuit, Molly Lewis, Rhett and Link, VenetianPrincess, NicePeter, Jason Munday and several others. Distribution of records by DFTBA Records is largely independent; Lastufka himself generally oversees most of the distribution. The goal of the record label, as Lastufka stated in a video on the subject, is to provide a distribution network for talented artists of YouTube and to make sure their music reaches out to the ""largest audience possible."" The record label claims to aid a bigger audience in connecting with the artists, and make the ""YouTube experience"" more lucrative, more exciting, and more fun. The offices of DFTBA Records were in Manhattan, Illinois, until early 2013 when they were moved to Hank's hometown of Missoula, Montana. VidCon. VidCon is an annual conference based around online video. The conference was created by Hank Green and his brother John in response to the growing online video community. Hank states, “We wanted to get as much of the online video community together, in one place, in the real world for a weekend. It's a celebration of the community, with performances, concerts, and parties; but it's also a discussion of the explosion in community-based online video.” The event draws many popular YouTube users, as well as their fans, and provides room for the community to interact. The event also contains an industry conference for people and businesses working in the online video field. The first Vidcon was hosted in July 2010. The second Vidcon took place on July 28–30, 2011. The third Vidcon also took place on June 28–30, 2012. The fourth VidCon took place on August 1-3, 2013. Discography. Also appears on: "
wikipedia-23998233," BBC Archives  The BBC Archives are collections documenting the BBC's broadcasting history, including copies of television and radio broadcasts, internal documents, photographs, online content, sheet music, commercially available music, press cuttings and historic equipment. These collections are kept as both original copies, but are now in the process of being digitised, estimated to take until approximately 2015, with some collections now being uploaded onto the BBC Archives website on BBC Online for viewers to see. The archive is one of the largest broadcast archives in the world with over 12 million items. Overview. The BBC Archives encompass numerous different archives containing different materials produced or acquired by the BBC. The earliest material dates back to 1890 and now consists of 1 million hours of playable material, in addition to documents, photographs and equipment. The archives contain 12 million items on 66 miles of shelving spread over several sites. The stock is managed using a bar code system, which help to locate material on the shelves and also track material that has been lent out. The BBC says that the budget for managing, protecting and digitising the archive accounts for only a small part of the BBC's overall spend. The BBC is engaging in an ongoing project to digitise archived programme material, converting recordings made on older analogue formats such as audio tape, videotape and film to electronic formats which are compatible with modern computer systems. Much of the audio-visual material was originally recorded on formats which are now obsolete and incompatible with modern broadcast equipment due to the fact that the machines used to reproduce many formats are no longer being manufactured. Additionally, some film and audio formats are slowly disintegrating, and digitisation also serves as a digital preservation programme. As of summer 2010 BBC Archive staff have spent approximately ten years digitising half of the media content and due to improving work practices expect to complete the other half in five years. Current estimates suggest the digitised archive would comprise approximately 52 petabytes of information, with one programme minute of video requiring 1.4 gigabytes of storage. The BBC uses the Material Exchange Format (MXF) which is an uncompressed, non-proprietary format which the BBC has been publicising to mitigate the threat of the format becoming obsolete (as digital formats can and do). The Archive digitisation a key part of the BBC's programme to engineer a fully digital and tapeless production workflow across the entire Corporation. It was closely tied in with the ill-fated Digital Media Initiative (DMI), a scheme which ran from 2008 to 2013 and attempted to create a unified online archive search and programme production system. After spiralling development costs and project delays, the problems with DMI came to public attention during coverage of the death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher in April 2013, when it was reported that the lack of digital ingest facilities provided for BBC News staff meant that tapes had to be sent by taxi from the Perivale centre to be digitised by independent companies in central London. DMI was cancelled in 2013. The BBC Archive website was relaunched online in 2008 and has provided newly released historical material regularly since then. The BBC works in partnership with the British Film Institute (BFI), The National Archives and other partners in working with and using the materials. A related project called ""Genome"" is expected to complete in 2011 and will make programme listings dating back to 1923, sourced from ""The Radio Times"", available to search online. In July 2008, Roly Keating was appointed Director of Archive Content, with responsibility for increasing public access to the BBC’s archives. In October 2008, Keating appointed Tony Ageh Controller of Archive Development with ""specific responsibility for developing ways of making the archive easily understandable and accessible to users"". Buildings. From 1968 to 2010 the BBC Archive was housed at the Archive centre in Windmill Road, Brentford, in West London. The condition of the building deteriorated over the years and suffered occasional flooding incidents, and eventually the Archive was relocated to a new centre at Perivale Park, Perivale, three miles north of the old site. The new BBC Archive Centre was opened in Summer 2010 and all material was successfully moved by March 2011. The cost of the refurbishment and of the move was approximately £16.6 million. Material is stored in thirteen vaults, controlled to match the best climate for the material inside them, and named after a different BBC personality depending on the content contained in them. In addition to the vaults, new editing and workrooms have been added so that the material can easily be transferred between formats as well as viewed and restored. The building has also been fitted with fire suppression systems to protect the archive in the event of an incident at the centre, so the total loss of the archive is avoided. Television Archive. The BBC Television Archive contains over 600,000 hours of television broadcast material located on 650,000 film reels and 2.4 million videotapes. The archive itself holds extensive material from approximately the mid-1970s onwards, when important recordings at the broadcaster were retained for the future. Recordings from before this date are less comprehensively preserved; the process of telerecording was originally invented in 1947 while videotape recording was gradually introduced from the late 1950s onwards, but due to the expense of the tapes, recording was seen for production use only with recordings subsequently being wiped. or telerecordings being junked. The exceptions in the early years were usually occasions of great importance, such as the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In addition, numerous programmes at the time were broadcast 'live' and so utilised no recording procedure in the production process. The earliest item in the collection is from 1936. Today, the majority of programmes are kept, including news, entertainment, drama and a selection of other long-running programmes such as quiz shows. The remaining material from the television archive is offered to the British Film Institute prior to being disposed of. Sound Archive. The BBC Sound Archive contains the archived output from the BBC's radio output. Widespread recordings exist in the archive from the mid-1930s, when recording of programmes and speeches were kept for rebroadcast; the catylist for this was the launch of the BBC Empire Service in 1932 and the subsequent rebroadcast of speeches from political leaders at a time convenient in the different time zones. Prior to this, the broadcast of recordings was seen as being false to the listener and was avoided. Any recordings made were frequently disposed of and it was the efforts of Marie Slocombe, who founded the Sound Archive in 1937 when she retained recordings of prominent figures in the country, that the archive became into being officially when she was appointed the Sounds Recording Librarian in 1941. Today, all of the BBC's radio output is recorded for re-use, with approximately 66% of output being preserved in the Archives; programmes involving guests or live performances from artists are kept whereas programmes in which the DJ plays commercially available music are only sampled and not kept entirely. Prior to any material being disposed of, the material is offered to the British Library Sound Archive. The archive consists of a number of different formats including 200 wax cylinders, numerous gramophone records made from both shellac and vinyl as well as numerous more recordings on tape, CD and on digital audio tape (DAT). The difficulty of these different formats is the availability of the machines required to play them; some of the vinyl records in the archive are 16 inches in size and require large phonograph units to play, while the players for the wax cylinders and DATs are no longer in production. The oldest item is a wax cylinder containing a recording made by Florence Nightingale, recorded on 30 July 1890. Another unique item is the gramophone record from Queen Mary's doll house, which is approximately an inch in size and had the national anthem on it. The Sound Archive is based at the new BBC Archive Centre in Perivale, along with the television archive, and was previously based at Windmill Road, Brentford. Written Archives. The BBC Written Archive contains all the internal written documents and communications from the corporation from the launch in 1922 to the present day. Its collections shed light into the behind the scenes workings of the corporation and also elaborate on the difficulties of getting a television or radio programme to or off the air as the case may be. The archive guidelines state that access to files post-1980 is restricted due to the current nature of the files; the general exception to this rule are documents such as scripts and Programme as Broadcast records. The Written Archives are located at the BBC Written Archive Centre in Caversham, Berkshire, near Reading. The centre houses the archive on four and a half miles of shelving along with reading rooms. The centre is different from the other BBC Archives in that the centre opens for writers and academic researchers in higher education. Photographic Library. The BBC Photographic Library is responsible for approximately 10 million images, dating back to 1922, created for publicity purposes and subsequently kept for future use. In addition to programme promotion, a large number of images are of historic events which are often incorporate into the daily news bulletins; as a result, half the photographic library team work specifically with these images. The images themselves are kept as originals in the archive, with digitisation only utilised when a specific image is required for use, when the image is sent in a digital format. Copies of images are also used in case any images are damaged, notable due to vinegar syndrome. The BBC Photographic library itself is based within BBC Television Centre, London. The most popular images from the Archive include Colin Firth in ""Pride and Prejudice"", Michael Parkinson interviewing Muhammad Ali, Jimmy Savile presenting the first ""Top of the Pops"", Martin Bashir interviewing Diana, Princess of Wales and a picture of Delia Derbyshire at work in the Radiophonic workshop at the BBC. Heritage Collection. The BBC Heritage Collection is the newest of the BBC Archives and holds a variety of historic broadcast technology, art, props and merchandise. The collection was created out of personal collections and bequeaths by former staff members, as the BBC had no formal policy on the heritage collection until c.2003. The collection includes, amongst other items, the BBC One NODD Globe and clock, a BBC-Marconi Type A microphone, an early crystal radio made by the British Broadcasting Company, a Marconi/EMI camera used in the early BBC Television experiments, a BBC Micro computer and a selection of items used to create Foley. In addition to all the broadcast technology, art is also kept, namely the portraits of all the BBC Director Generals, as well as props including an original TARDIS from ""Doctor Who"" and the children's television puppet Gordon the Gopher. The heritage collection itself has no one permanent home, as the majority of objects are on display, either around BBC properties or on loan to museums or other collections; the most notable museum housing the collection is the National Media Museum in Bradford. Archive Treasure Hunt. At the turn of the millennium, the BBC launched the BBC Archive Treasure Hunt, a public appeal to recover pre-1980s lost BBC radio and television productions. Original material, featuring several popular programmes were lost due to the practice of wiping, copyright issues and for technological reasons. The resolution of this appeal was that over one hundred productions were recovered including ""The Men from the Ministry"", ""Something To Shout About"", ""Man and Superman"", ""The Doctor's Dilemma"", ""I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again"", ""Hancock's Half Hour"", ""I'm Sorry, I Haven't A Clue"" and ""The Ronnie Corbett Thing"" in addition to recording sessions with Elton John, Ringo Starr and Paul Simon. Also, the Peter Sellers Estate Collection donated numerous recordings featuring Peter Sellers. Creative Archive Licence. The BBC together with the British Film Institute, the Open University, Channel 4 and Teachers' TV formed a collaboration, named the Creative Archive Licence Group, to create a copyright licence for the re-release of archived material. The Licence was a trial, launched in 2005, and notable for the re-release of part of the BBC News' archive and programmes made by the BBC Natural History Unit for creative use by the public. While artists and teachers are encouraged to use the content to create works of their own, the terms of the licence are restrictive compared to other copyleft licences. Use of Creative Archive content for commercial, ""endorsement, campaigning, defamatory or derogatory purposes"" is forbidden, any derivative works must be released under the same licence, and content may only be used within the UK. The trial ended in 2006 following a review by the BBC Trust and works released under the license were withdrawn. Voices from the archives. Voices from the Archives is a former BBC project, launched in partnership with BBC Four that provided free access to audio interviews with various notable people and professions from a variety of political, religious and social backgrounds. The website ceased to be updated in June 2005, and the concept was instead adopted by BBC Radio 4 as a collection of film interviews from various programmes. "

wikipedia-23908722," Umberto I of Italy  Umberto I or Humbert I (, ; 14 March 1844 – 29 July 1900), nicknamed ""the Good"" (in Italian ""il Buono""), was the King of Italy from 9 January 1878 until his death. Umberto's reign saw Italy attempt colonial expansion into East Africa, successfully gaining Eritrea and Somalia despite being defeated by Abyssinia at the Battle of Adowa in 1886. In 1882, he approved the Triple Alliance with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. He was deeply loathed in leftist circles, because of his conservatism and support of the Bava-Beccaris massacre in Milan. He was especially hated by anarchists, who attempted an assassination on him during the first year of his reign. He was killed by another anarchist, Gaetano Bresci, two years after the Bava-Bacharis massacre. Youth. The son of Victor Emmanuel II and Archduchess Adelaide of Austria, Umberto was born in Turin, which was then capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia, on 14 March 1844, his father's 24th birthday. His education was entrusted to, amongst others, Massimo Taparelli, marquis d'Azeglio and Pasquale Stanislao Mancini. From March 1858 he had a military career in the Sardinian army, beginning with the rank of captain. Umberto took part in the Italian Wars of Independence: he was present at the battle of Solferino in 1859, and in 1866 commanded the XVI Division at the Villafranca battle that followed the Italian defeat at Custoza. Because of the upheaval the Savoys caused to a number of other royal houses (all the Italian ones, and those related closely with them, such as the Bourbons of Spain and France) in 1859–60, only a minority of royal families in the 1860s were willing to establish relations with the newly founded Italian royal family. It proved difficult to find any royal bride for either of the sons of king Victor Emmanuel II. (His younger son Amedeo, Umberto's brother, married ultimately a Piedmontese subject, princess Vittoria of Cisterna.) Their conflict with the papacy did not help these matters. Not many eligible Catholic royal brides were easily available for young Umberto. At first, Umberto was to marry Archduchess Mathilde of Austria, a scion of a remote sideline of the Austrian imperial house; however, she died as the result of an accident at the age of 18. On 21 April 1868 Umberto married his first cousin, Margherita Teresa Giovanna, Princess of Savoy. Their only son was Victor Emmanuel, prince of Naples. She was one of the rare young ladies of any royal house available to the despised Savoy royal family in that decade – being a Savoy herself. Reign. Ascending the throne on the death of his father (9 January 1878), Umberto adopted the title ""Umberto I of Italy"" rather than ""Umberto IV"" (of Savoy), and consented that the remains of his father should be interred at Rome in the Pantheon, rather than the royal mausoleum of Basilica of Superga. First assassination attempt. While on a tour of the kingdom, accompanied by Queen Margherita and the Prime Minister Benedetto Cairoli, he was attacked with a dagger by an anarchist, Giovanni Passannante, during a parade in Naples on 17 November 1878. The King warded off the blow with his sabre, but Cairoli, in attempting to defend him, was severely wounded in the thigh. The would-be assassin was condemned to death, even though the law only allowed the death penalty if the King was killed. The King commuted the sentence to one of penal servitude for life, which was served in a cell only 1.4 meters high, without sanitation and with 18 kilograms of chains. Passanante would later die in a psychiatric institution. The incident upset the health of Queen Margherita for several years. Foreign policy. In foreign policy Umberto I approved the Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and Germany, repeatedly visiting Vienna and Berlin. Many in Italy, however, viewed with hostility an alliance with their former Austrian enemies, who were still occupying areas claimed by Italy. Umberto was also favorably disposed towards the policy of colonial expansion inaugurated in 1885 by the occupation of Massawa in Eritrea. Italy expanded into Somalia in the 1880s as well. Umberto I was suspected of aspiring to a vast empire in north-east Africa, a suspicion which tended somewhat to diminish his popularity after the disastrous Battle of Adowa in Ethiopia on 1 March 1896. In the summer of 1900, Italian forces were part of the Eight-Nation Alliance which participated in the Boxer Rebellion in Imperial China. Through the Boxer Protocol, signed after Umberto's death, the Kingdom of Italy gained a concession territory in Tientsin. Umberto's attitude towards the Holy See was uncompromising. In a 1886 telegram, he declared Rome ""untouchable"" and affirmed the permanence of the Italian possession of the ""Eternal City"". Turmoil. The reign of Umberto I was a time of social upheaval, though it was later claimed to have been a tranquil ""belle époque"". Social tensions mounted as a consequence of the relatively recent occupation of the kingdom of the two Sicilies, the spread of socialist ideas, public hostility to the colonialist plans of the various governments, especially Crispi's, and the numerous crackdowns on civil liberties. The protesters included the young Benito Mussolini, then a member of the socialist party. On 22 April 1897, Umberto I was attacked again, by an unemployed ironsmith, Pietro Acciarito, who tried to stab him near Rome. Bava-Beccaris massacre. During the colonial wars in Africa, large demonstrations over the rising price of bread were held in Italy and on 7 May 1898 the city of Milan was put under military control by General Fiorenzo Bava-Beccaris, who ordered the use of cannon on the demonstrators; as a result, about 100 people were killed according to the authorities (some claim the death toll was about 350); about a thousand were wounded. King Umberto sent a telegram to congratulate Bava-Beccaris on the restoration of order and later decorated him with the medal of Great Official of Savoy Military Order, greatly outraging a large part of the public opinion. Assassination. On the evening of 29 July 1900, Umberto was assassinated when he was shot four times by the Italo-American anarchist Gaetano Bresci in Monza. Bresci claimed he wanted to avenge the people killed during the Bava-Beccaris massacre. Umberto was buried in the Pantheon in Rome, by the side of his father Victor Emmanuel II, on 9 August 1900. He was the last Savoy to be buried there, as his son and successor Victor Emmanuel III died in exile and is still buried in Egypt. American anarchist Leon Czolgosz claimed that the assassination of Umberto I was his inspiration to kill U. S. President William McKinley in September 1901. Titles as King of Italy. From 1860 to 1946, the following titles were used by the King of Italy: Umberto the First, by the Grace of God, King of Italy, King of Sardinia, Cyprus, Jerusalem, Armenia, Duke of Savoy, count of Maurienne, Marquis (of the Holy Roman Empire) in Italy; prince of Piedmont, Carignano, Oneglia, Poirino, Trino; Prince and Perpetual vicar of the Holy Roman Empire; prince of Carmagnola, Montmellian with Arbin and Francin, prince bailliff of the Duchy of Aosta, Prince of Chieri, Dronero, Crescentino, Riva di Chieri e Banna, Busca, Bene, Brà, Duke of Genoa, Monferrat, Aosta, Duke of Chablais, Genevois, Duke of Piacenza, Marquis of Saluzzo (Saluces), Ivrea, Susa, del Maro, Oristano, Cesana, Savona, Tarantasia, Borgomanero e Cureggio, Caselle, Rivoli, Pianezza, Govone, Salussola, Racconigi con Tegerone, Migliabruna e Motturone, Cavallermaggiore, Marene, Modane e Lanslebourg, Livorno Ferraris, Santhià Agliè, Centallo e Demonte, Desana, Ghemme, Vigone, Count of Barge, Villafranca, Ginevra, Nizza, Tenda, Romont, Asti, Alessandria, del Goceano, Novara, Tortona, Bobbio, Soissons, Sant'Antioco, Pollenzo, Roccabruna, Tricerro, Bairo, Ozegna, delle Apertole, Baron of Vaud e del Faucigni, Lord of Vercelli, Pinerolo, della Lomellina, della Valle Sesia, del marchesato di Ceva, Overlord of Monaco, Roccabruna and 11/12th of Menton, Noble patrician of Venice, patrician of Ferrara.

It is part of the long history of attempts at land reform in the Philippines. It is Republic Act No. 6657. The law was outlined by former President Corazon C. Aquino through Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order 229 on June 22, 1987. The law was enacted by the 8th Congress of the Philippines and signed by Aquino on June 10, 1988. In this program, all lands exceeding seven hectares were bought by the government and sold to the landless farmers. Owners of lands were paid through installment basis for 15 years. Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms. Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms, known also as CALPER or CARPer, (Republic Act 9700) was an extension of CARP that was passed in 2009 and is set to expire in 2014. In December 2008, the budget for CARP has expired and there remained 1.2 million hectares of agricultural lands waiting to be acquired and distributed to farmers. "
wikipedia-23908940," Child pornography laws in Australia  Child pornography laws in Australia prohibit all sexual depictions of children under the age of 18 (or under 16 in some states). This often includes images of people who merely appear to be under 18. For instance, magazine photographs of women with A breast cup sizes have been censored in recent years, reportedly leading to an increase in the average breast size of women in Australian magazines.  Furthermore, there is a zero-tolerance policy in place, which covers purely fictional children as well as real children. The possession, production, distribution, import, export, sale, or access over the internet of child pornography is punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine up to A$120,000 as well as sex offender register requirements. Japanese anime. In August 2007, an Australian was sentenced to pay an A$9,000 fine for attempting to import eight DVDs of Japanese anime found to contain pornographic depictions of children and 14 found to contain depictions of sexual violence. No images of real children were involved. ""Customs National Manager Investigations, Richard Janeczko, said that it was important to understand that even cartoons or drawings such as those depicted in anime were prohibited if they contained offensive sexual content."" Cartoon depictions. Also, in December 2008, a New South Wales Supreme Court judge, Justice Michael Adams, ruled to uphold a magistrate's decision that a pornographic cartoon parodying characters on The Simpsons (Bart and Lisa) was child pornography, because ""follows that a fictional cartoon character, even one which departs from recognisable human forms in some significant respects, may nevertheless be the depiction of a person within the meaning of the Act."" The Appellant, Alan John McEwan, was fined $3000 Aus ($3,170 US). Judge Adams explained the law was appropriate because cartoons could """"fuel demand for material that does involve the abuse of children"""", also adding """"A cartoon character might well constitute the depiction of such a person"""". A BBC reporter summarized the judge's decision: """"he decided that the mere fact that they were not realistic representations of human beings did not mean that they could not be considered people"""". This case has attracted international attention, alongside attention to more local cases, with author Neil Gaiman commenting on it: ""I suspect the Judge might have just granted human rights to cartoon characters. I think it's nonsensical in every way that it could possibly be nonsensical."" Case concerning a written work. In March 2011, a Tasmanian man was convicted with possessing child pornography after police investigators discovered an electronic copy of a nineteenth-century written work, ""The Pearl"" by Anonymous on his computer. Harper Collins is the most recent publisher of the ""The Pearl"", which is available for purchase within Australia. However the conviction was set aside on appeal. "
wikipedia-23909036," Radioactive iodine uptake test  The radioactive iodine uptake test, or RAIU test, is a type of scan used in the diagnosis of thyroid problems, particularly hyperthyroidism. It is entirely different from radioactive iodine therapy (RAI therapy), which uses much higher doses to destroy cancerous cells. The RAIU test is also used as a follow up to RAI therapy to verify that no thyroid cells survived, which could potentially still be cancerous. The patient swallows radioactive iodine in the form of capsule or fluid, and its absorption by the thyroid is studied after 4–6 hours and after 24 hours with the aid of a scintillation counter. The dose is typically 0.15–0.37 MBq (4–10 μCi) of 131I sodium iodide, or 3.7–7.4 MBq (100–200 μCi) of 123I sodium iodide. The normal uptake is between 15 and 25 percent, but this may be forced down if, in the meantime, the patient has eaten foods high in iodine, such as dairy products and seafood. Low uptake suggests thyroiditis, high uptake suggests Graves' disease, and unevenness in uptake suggests the presence of a nodule. The test is inappropriate for patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. I-123 has a shorter half life than I-131 (a half day vs. 8.1 days), so use of I-123 exposes the body to less radiation, but at the expense of less time to evaluate delayed scan images. Also, I-123 emits gamma radiation, while I-131 emits gamma and beta radiation. "

wikipedia-23909513," Isabella I of Castile  Isabella I (, Old Spanish: ""Ysabel I""; 22 April 1451 – 26 November 1504), also known as Isabella the Catholic, was queen of Castile and León (Crown of Castile). She and her husband, Ferdinand II of Aragon, brought stability to the kingdoms that became the basis for the political unification of Spain under their grandson, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. After a struggle to claim her right to the throne, she reorganized the governmental system, brought the crime rate to the lowest it had been in years, and unburdened the kingdom of the enormous debt her brother had left behind. Her reforms and those she made with her husband had an influence that extended well beyond the borders of their united kingdoms. Isabella and Ferdinand are known for completing the Reconquista, ordering conversion or exile of their Muslim and Jewish subjects and for supporting and financing Christopher Columbus' 1492 voyage that led to the opening of the ""New World"". Isabella was granted the title Servant of God by the Catholic Church in 1974. Life and reign. Early years. Isabella was born in Madrigal de las Altas Torres, Ávila, to John II of Castile and Isabella of Portugal on 22 April 1451. At the time of her birth, her older half-brother Henry preceded her in the line of succession. Henry was 26 at that time and married but childless. Her younger brother Alfonso was born two years later on 17 November 1453 and displaced her in the line of succession. When her father died in 1454, her half-brother ascended the throne as Henry IV. Isabella and Alfonso were left in Henry's care. She, her mother and her brother Alfonso then moved to Arévalo. These were times of turmoil for Isabella. Living conditions in their castle in Arevalo were poor, and they suffered from a shortage of money. Although her father arranged in his will for his children to be financially well taken care of, her half-brother Henry did not comply with their father's wishes, either from a desire to keep his half-siblings restricted or from ineptitude. Even though living conditions were lackluster, under the careful eye of her mother, Isabella was instructed in lessons of practical piety and in a deep reverence for religion. When the King's wife, Joan of Portugal, was about to give birth to their daughter Joanna, Isabella and Alfonso were summoned to court (Segovia) to come under the direct supervision of the King and to finish their education. Alfonso was placed in the care of a tutor while Isabella became part of the Queen's household. Some of Isabella's living conditions improved in Segovia. She always had food and clothing and lived in a castle that was adorned with gold and silver. Isabella's basic education consisted of reading, spelling, writing, grammar, mathematics, art, chess, dancing, embroidery, music, and religious instruction. She and her ladies-in-waiting entertained themselves with art, embroidery, and music. She lived a relaxed lifestyle, but she rarely left Segovia as Henry forbade this. Her half-brother was keeping her from the political turmoils going on in the kingdom, though Isabella had full knowledge of what was going on and of her role in the feuds. The noblemen, anxious for power, confronted King Henry, demanding that his younger half brother Infante Alfonso be named his successor. They even went so far as to ask Alfonso to seize the throne. The nobles, now in control of Alfonso and claiming that he was the true heir, clashed with Henry's forces at the Second Battle of Olmedo in 1467. The battle was a draw. Henry agreed to recognise Alfonso as heir presumptive, provided that he would marry his daughter, Joanna. Soon after he was named Prince of Asturias, Alfonso died in July 1468, likely of the plague. The nobles who had supported him suspected poisoning. As she had been named in her brother's will as his successor, the nobles asked Isabella to take his place as champion of the rebellion. However, support for the rebels had begun to wane, and Isabella preferred a negotiated settlement to continuing the war. She met with Henry and, at Toros de Guisando, they reached a compromise: the war would stop, Henry would name Isabella his heir-presumptive instead of Joanna, and Isabella would not marry without Henry's consent but he would not be able to force her to marry against her will. Isabella's side came out with most of what they desired, though they did not go so far as to officially depose Henry: they were not powerful enough to do so, and Isabella did not want to jeopardize the principle of fair inherited succession, since it was upon this idea that she had based her argument for legitimacy as heir-presumptive. Marriage. From an extremely early age, Isabella was forced into several betrothals by her brother Henry, all of which were beneficial to his political needs of the time. By the age of six, Isabella made her debut in the matrimonial market with a betrothal to Ferdinand, son of John II of Navarre (whose family was a cadet branch of the House of Trastámara). At the time the two kings, Henry and John, were eager to show their mutual love and confidence and they believed that this double alliance would make their eternal friendship obvious to the world. This arrangement, however, did not last long. When Alfonso V of Aragon died in 1458, all of his Spanish territories as well as the islands of Sicily and Sardinia, were left to his brother John II. John now had a stronger position than ever before and no longer needed the security of Henry's friendship. Henry was now in need of a new alliance. He saw the chance for this much needed new friendship in Charles of Viana, John's elder son. Charles was constantly at odds with his father and because of this he secretly entered into an alliance with Henry IV of Castile. A major part of the alliance was that a marriage was to be arranged between Charles and Isabella. When John II learned of this arranged marriage he was outraged. Isabella had been destined for his favorite son, Ferdinand, and in his eyes this alliance was still valid. John II had his son Charles thrown in prison on charges of plotting against his father's life; Charles died in 1461. In 1465 an attempt was made to marry Isabella to Alfonso V of Portugal, Henry's brother-in-law. Through the medium of the Queen and Count of Ledesma, a Portuguese alliance was made. Isabella, however, was wary of the marriage and refused to consent. A civil war broke out in Castile over King Henry's inability to act as sovereign. Henry now needed a quick way to please the rebels of the kingdom. As part of an agreement to restore peace, Isabella was to be betrothed to Pedro Giron, Maestre de Order of Calatrava and brother to the King’s favorite, Juan Pacheco. In return, Don Pedro would pay into the impoverished royal treasury an enormous sum of money. Seeing no alternative, Henry agreed to the marriage. Isabella was aghast and prayed to God that the marriage would not come to pass. Her prayers were answered when Don Pedro suddenly fell ill and died while on his way to meet his fiancée. When Henry recognized Isabella as his heir-presumptive on 19 September 1468, he also promised that his sister should not be compelled to marry against her will, while she in return agreed to obtain his consent. It seemed that finally the years of failed attempts at political marriages were over. There was talk of a marriage to Edward IV of England or to one of his brothers, probably Richard, Duke of Gloucester, but this alliance was never seriously considered. Once again in 1468, a marriage proposal arrived from Alfonso V of Portugal. Going against his promises made in September, Henry tried to make the marriage a reality. If Isabella married Alfonso, Henry's daughter Joanna would marry Alfonso's son John II and thus, after the death of the old king, John and Joanna could inherit Portugal and Castile. Isabella refused and made a secret promise to marry her cousin and very first betrothed, Ferdinand of Aragon. After this failed attempt Henry once again went against his promises and tried to marry Isabella to Louis XI’s brother Charles, Duke of Berry. In Henry's eyes this alliance would cement the friendship of Castile and France as well as remove Isabella from Castilian affairs. Isabella once again refused the proposal. Meanwhile John II of Aragon negotiated in secret with Isabella a wedding to his son Ferdinand. On 18 October 1469, the formal betrothal took place. Because Isabella and Ferdinand were second cousins they stood within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity and the marriage would not be legal unless a dispensation from the Pope was obtained. With the help of the Valencian cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (later Alexander VI) Isabella and Ferdinand were presented with a supposed Papal Bull by Pius II authorizing Ferdinand to marry within the third degree of consanguinity, making their marriage legal. Isabella escaped the court of Henry with the excuse of visiting her brother Alfonso's tomb in Ávila. Ferdinand, on the other hand, crossed Castile in secret disguised as a servant. Finally, on 19 October 1469 they married in the Palacio de los Vivero in the city of Valladolid. War with Portugal. Isabella’s reign got off to a rocky start. Because her brother had named Isabella as his successor, when she ascended to the throne in 1474, there were already several plots against her. Diego Pacheco, the Marquis of Villena, and his followers maintained that the Joanna, daughter of Henry IV, was the rightful queen. Shortly after the Marquis made his claim, a longtime supporter of Isabella, the Archbishop of Toledo left court to plot with his great-nephew the Marquis. The Archbishop and Marquis made plans to have the Infanta Joanna marry her uncle, King Alfonso V of Portugal and invade Castile to claim the throne for themselves. In May 1475, Alfonso and his army crossed into Spain and advanced to Plasencia. Here he married the young Joanna. A long and bloody war for the Castilian succession then took place. The war went back and forth for almost a year until 1 March 1476 when the Battle of Toro took place, a battle in which both sides claimed victory and celebrated the victory: the troops of Afonso V were beaten by the Castilian centre-left commanded by the Duke of Alba and Cardinal Mendoza while the forces led by Prince John of Portugal defeated the Castilian right wing and remained in possession of the battlefield. But despite its uncertain outcome, the Battle of Toro represented a great political victory for the Catholic Monarchs, assuring them the throne since the supporters of Juana disbanded and the Portuguese army, without allies, left Castile. As summarized by the historian Justo L. González: """"Both armies faced each other at the camps of Toro resulting in an indecisive battle. But while the Portuguese King reorganized his troops, Ferdinand sent news to all the cities of Castile and to several foreign kingdoms informing them about a huge victory where the Portuguese were crushed. Faced with these news, the party of “la Beltraneja"" ""was dissolved and the Portuguese were forced to return to their kingdom."""" With great political vision, Isabella took advantage of the moment and convoked courts at Madrigal-Segovia (April–October 1476) where her daughter was sworn heiress of Castile's crown. That was equivalent to legitimizing Isabella’s own throne. In August of the same year, Isabella proved her abilities as a powerful ruler on her own. A rebellion broke out in Segovia and Isabella rode out to suppress it, as her husband was off fighting at the time. Going against the advice of her male advisors, Isabella rode by herself into the city to negotiate with the rebels. She was successful and the rebellion was quickly brought to an end. Two years later, Isabella further secured her place as ruler with the birth of her son John, Prince of Asturias, on 30 June 1478. To many, the presence of a male heir legitimized her place as ruler. Meanwhile the Castilian and Portuguese fleets fought for hegemony in the Atlantic Ocean and for the wealth of Guinea (gold and slaves) where the decisive naval Battle of Guinea was fought. The war dragged on for another three years and ended with a Castilian victory on land and a Portuguese victory on the sea. The four separate peace treaties signed at Alcáçovas (4 September 1479) reflected that result: Portugal gave up the throne of Castile in favour of Isabella in exchange for a very favorable share of the Atlantic territories disputed with Castile (they all went to Portugal with the exception of the Canary Islands: Guinea with its mines of Gold, Cape Verde, Madeira, Azores and the right of conquest over the kingdom of Fez) plus a big war compensation: 106.676 dobles of gold. The Catholic Monarchs also had to accept that Joanna remain in Portugal instead of Spain and to pardon all rebellious subjects who had supported Joanna and Alfonso. And the Catholic monarchs – who had proclaimed themselves rulers of Portugal and donated lands to noblemen inside this country – had to give up the Portuguese crown. At Alcáçovas, Isabella and Ferdinand had conquered the throne but the Portuguese exclusive right of navigation and commerce in all the Atlantic ocean south of the Canary islands meant that Spain stayed practically out of the Atlantic and was deprived of the Gold of Guinea, which induced anger in Andalusia. Spanish academic Antonio Rumeu de Armas stated that with the Peace treaty of Alcáçovas,1479, the Catholic Monarchs """"... buy the peace at an excessively expensive price... "" and historian Mª Monserrat Léon Guerrero added that they """" find themselves forced to abandon their expansion by the Atlantic... """" It would be Columbus who would free Castile from this difficult situation of blocked overseas expansion, because his New World discovery led to a new and much more balanced sharing of the Atlantic at Tordesilhas in 1494. The orders received by Columbus in his first voyage (1492) are elucidative: ""“...""Catholic Monarchs ""have always in mind that the limits signed in the “share” of Alcáçovas should not be overcome, and thus they insist with Columbus to sail along the parallel of Canary.”"" Thus, when sponsoring the Columbian adventure to the West the Monarchs were trying the only remaining way of expansion. As it is known, they would be extremely successful on this issue. Isabella had proven herself to be a fighter and tough monarch from the start. Now that she had succeeded in securing her place on the Castilian throne, she could now begin to make the reforms that the kingdom desperately needed. Reform. Regulation of crime. When Isabella came to the throne in 1474, Castile was in a state of despair thanks to her brother Henry’s reign. It was not unknown that Henry IV was a big spender and did little to enforce the laws of his kingdom. It was even said by one Castilian citizen of the time that murder, rape, and robbery happened without punishment. Because of this, Isabella needed desperately to find a way to reform her kingdom. Due to the measures imposed, historians during her lifetime saw her to be more inclined to justice than to mercy, and indeed far more rigorous and unforgiving than her husband Ferdinand. La Santa Hermandad. Isabella’s first major reform came during the cortes of Madrigal in 1476 in the form of a police force, La Santa Hermandad (the Holy Brotherhood). While 1476 was not the first time that Castile had seen the Hermandad, it was however the first time that the police force was used by the crown. During the late medieval period, the expression hermandad had been used to describe groups of men who came together of their own accord to regulate law and order by patrolling the roads and countryside and punishing malefactors. These brotherhoods, however, had usually been suppressed by the monarch. Before 1476, the justice system in most parts of the country was effectively under the control of dissident members of the nobility rather than royal officials. To fix this problem, during the Cortes of 1476, a general Hermandad was established for Castile, Leon, and Asturias. The police force was to be made up of locals who were to regulate the crime occurring in the kingdom. It was to be paid for by a tax of 1800 mavedus on every one hundred households. In 1477, Isabella visited Extremadura and Andalusia to introduce this more efficient police force there as well. Other criminal reforms. Keeping with her reformation of the regulation of laws, in 1481 Isabella charged two officials with restoring peace in Galicia. This turbulent province had been the prey of tyrant nobles since the days of Isabella’s father, John II. Robbers infested the highways and oppressed the smaller towns and villages. These officials set off with the Herculean task of restoring peace for the province. The officials were successful. They succeeded in driving over 1,500 robbers from Galicia. Finances. From the very beginning of her reign, Isabella fully grasped the importance of restoring the Crown's finances. The reign of Henry IV had left the kingdom of Castile in great debt. Upon examination, it was found that the chief cause of the nation’s poverty was the wholesale alienation of royal estates during Henry’s reign. In order to make money, Henry had sold off royal estates at prices well below their value. The Cortes of Toledo of 1480 came to the conclusion that the only hope of lasting financial reform lay in a resumption of these alienated lands and rents. This decision was warmly approved by many leading nobles of the Court but Isabella was reluctant to take such large actions. It was decided that the Cardinal of Spain would hold an enquiry into the tenure of estates and rents acquired during Henry IV’s reign. Those that had not been granted as a reward for services were to be restored without compensation; while those that had been sold at a price far below their real value were to be brought back at the same sum. While many of the nobility were forced to pay large sums of money for their estates, the royal treasury became ever richer. Isabella’s one stipulation was that there would be no revocation of gifts made to churches, hospitals, or the poor. Another issue of money was the over production of coinage and the abundance of mints in the kingdom. During Henry’s reign the number of mints regularly producing money had increased from just five to one hundred and fifty. Much of the coinage produced in these mints was nearly worthless. During the first year of her reign Isabella established a monopoly over the royal mints and fixed a legal standard to which the coinage must approximate. By shutting down many of the mints and taking royal control over the production of money, Isabella restored the confidence of the public in the crown’s ability to handle the kingdom’s finance. Government. It has been noted that both Isabella and Ferdinand established very few new governmental and administrative institutions in their respective kingdoms. Especially in Castile, the main achievement was to use more effectively the institutions that had existed during the reigns of John II and Henry IV. Historically, the center of the Castilian government had been the royal household, together with its surrounding court. The household was traditionally divided into two overlapping bodies. The first body was made up of household officials, mainly people of the nobility, who carried out governmental and political functions for which they received special payment. The second body was made up of some 200 permanent servants or continos who performed a wide range of confidential functions on behalf of the rulers. By the 1470s when Isabella began to take a firm grip on the royal administration, the senior offices of the royal household were simply honorary titles and held strictly by the nobility. The positions of a more secretarial nature were often held by senior churchmen. Substantial revenues were attached to such offices and were therefore enjoyed greatly, on an effectively hereditary basis, by the great Castilian houses of nobility. While the nobles held the titles, those individuals of lesser breeding did the real work. Traditionally, the main advisory body to the rulers of Castile was the Royal Council. The Council, under the monarch, had full power to resolve all legal and political disputes. The Council was responsible for supervising all senior administrative officials, such as the Crown representatives in all of the major towns. It was also the supreme judicial tribunal of the kingdom. In 1480, during the Cortes of Toledo, Isabella made many reforms to the Royal Council. Previously there had been two distinct yet overlapping categories of royal councilor. One formed a group which possessed both judicial and administrative responsibilities. This portion consisted of some bishops, some nobles, and an increasingly important element of professional administrators with legal training known as letrados. The second category of traditional councilor had a less formal role. This role depended greatly on the individuals’ political influence and personal influence with the monarch. During Isabella’s reign, the role of this second category was completely eliminated. As mentioned previously, Isabella had little care for personal bribes or favors. Because of this, this second type of councilor, usually of the nobility, was only allowed to attend the council of Castile as an observer. Isabella began to rely more on the professional administrators than ever before. These men were mostly of the bourgeoisie or lesser nobility. The Council was also rearranged and it was officially settled that one bishop, three caballeros, and eight or nine lawyers would serve on the council at a time. While the nobles were no longer directly involved in the matters of state, they were welcome to attend the meetings. Isabel hoped by forcing the nobility to choose whether to participate or not would weed out those who were not dedicated to the state and its cause. Isabella also saw the need to provide a personal relationship between herself as the monarch and her subjects. Therefore, Isabella and Ferdinand set aside a time every Friday during which they themselves would sit and allow people to come to them with complaints. This was a new form of personal justice that Castile had not seen before. The Council of State was reformed and presided over by the King and Queen. This department of public affairs dealt mainly with foreign negotiations, hearing embassies, and transacting business with the Court of Rome. In addition to these departments, there was also a Supreme Court of the Santa Hermandad, a Council of Finance, and a Council for settling purely Aragonese matters. Although Isabella made many reforms that seem to have made the Cortes stronger, in actuality the Cortes lost political power during the reigns of Isabella and Ferdinand. Isabella and her husband moved in the direction of a non-parliamentary government and the Cortes became an almost passive advisory body, giving automatic assent to legislation which had been drafted by the royal administration. After the reforms of the Cortes of Toledo, the Queen ordered a noted jurist, Alfonso Diaz de Montalvo, to undertake the task of clearing away legal rubbish and compiling what remained into a comprehensive code. Within four years the work stood completed in eight bulky volumes and the Ordenanzas Reales took their place on legal bookshelves. Events of 1492. Granada. At the end of the Reconquista, only Granada was left for Isabella and Ferdinand to conquer. The Emirate of Granada had been held by the Muslim Nasrid emirate since the mid-thirteenth century. Protected by natural barriers and fortified towns, it had withstood the long process of the reconquista. On 1 February 1482, the king and queen reached Medina del Campo and this is generally considered the beginning of the war for Granada. While Isabella's and Ferdinand's involvement in the war was apparent from the start, Granada's leadership was divided and never able to present united front. However, it still took ten years to conquer Granada, culminating in 1492. The Spanish monarchs recruited soldiers from many European countries and improved their artillery with the latest and best cannons. Systematically, they proceeded to take the kingdom piece by piece. In 1485 they laid siege to Ronda, which surrendered after only a fortnight due to extensive bombardment. The following year, Loja was taken, and again Muhammad XII was captured and released. One year later, with the fall of Málaga, the western part of the Muslim Nasrid kingdom had fallen into Spanish hands. The eastern province succumbed after the fall of Baza in 1489. The siege of Granada began in the spring of 1491 and at the end of the year, Muhammad XII surrendered. On 2 January 1492 Isabella and Ferdinand entered Granada to receive the keys of the city and the principal mosque was reconsecrated as a church. The Treaty of Granada was signed later that year, and in it Ferdinand and Isabella gave their word to allow the Muslims and Jews of Granada to live in peace. An uprising by the Moors in 1500 caused the Catholic side to consider that the Moors had violated the Treaty: this gave them a justification for revoking its provisions. See Morisco Revolt. During the war, Isabella noted the abilities and energy of Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba and made him one of the two commissioners for the negotiations. Under her patronage, De Córdoba went on to an extraordinary military career that revolutionized the organization and tactics of the emerging Spanish military; changing the nature of warfare and altering the European balance of power. Columbus and Portuguese relations. Just three months after entering Granada, Queen Isabella agreed to sponsor Christopher Columbus on an expedition to reach the Indies by sailing west (2000 miles, according to Columbus). The crown agreed to pay a sum of money as a concession from monarch to subject. On 3 August 1492 his expedition departed and arrived in what is now known as Watling Island on 12 October. He named it San Salvador, after Jesus the Savior. He returned the next year and presented his findings to the monarchs, bringing natives and gold under a hero's welcome. Although Columbus was sponsored by the Castilian queen, treasury accounts show no royal payments to him until 1493, after his first voyage was complete. Spain entered a Golden Age of exploration and colonization, the period of the Spanish Empire. The Portuguese did not recognize that South America belonged to the Spanish because it was on Portugal's sphere of influence and the Portuguese King John II threatened to send an army to claim the land for the Portuguese. In 1494, by the Treaty of Tordesillas, Isabella and Ferdinand agreed to divide the Earth, outside of Europe, with king John II of Portugal. Isabella was not favorable towards Columbus' enslavement of the American natives and attempted to enforce the recent policies of the Canaries upon the 'New World', stating that all peoples were under the subject of the Castilian Crown and couldn't be enslaved in most situations. The principles she established would have very little effect during her lifetime, however. Expulsion of the Jews. With the institution of the Roman Catholic Inquisition in Spain, and with the Dominican friar Tomás de Torquemada as the first Inquisitor General, the Catholic Monarchs pursued a policy of religious and national unity. Though Isabella opposed taking harsh measures against Jews on economic grounds, Torquemada was able to convince Ferdinand. On 31 March 1492, the Alhambra Decree for the expulsion of the Jews was issued (See main article on Inquisition). The Jews had until the end of July, three months, to leave the country and they were not to take with them gold, silver, money, arms, or horses. Traditionally, it had been claimed that as many as 200,000 Jews left Spain, but recent historians have shown that such figures are exaggerated: Henry Kamen has shown that out of a total population of 80,000 Jews, a maximum of 40,000 left and the rest converted. Hundreds of those that remained came under the Inquisition's investigations into relapsed ""conversos"" (Marranos) and the Judaizers who had been abetting them. Later years. Isabella received the title of Catholic Monarch by Pope Alexander VI, a pope of whose behaviour and involvement in secular matters Isabella did not approve. Along with the physical unification of Spain, Isabella and Ferdinand embarked on a process of spiritual unification, trying to bring the country under one faith (Roman Catholicism). As part of this process, the Inquisition became institutionalized. After a Muslim uprising in 1499, and further troubles thereafter, the Treaty of Granada was broken in 1502, and Muslims were ordered to either become Christians or to leave. Isabella's confessor, Cisneros, was named Archbishop of Toledo. He was instrumental in a program of rehabilitation of the religious institutions of Spain, laying the groundwork for the later Counter-Reformation. As Chancellor, he exerted more and more power. Isabella and her husband had created an empire and in later years were consumed with administration and politics; they were concerned with the succession and worked to link the Spanish crown to the other rulers in Europe. By early 1497 all the pieces seemed to be in place: John, Prince of Asturias, married Archduchess Margaret of Austria, establishing the connection to the Habsburgs. The eldest daughter, Isabella, married Manuel I of Portugal, and Joanna was married to another Habsburg prince, Philip of Burgundy.  However, Isabella's plans for her two eldest children did not work out. John died shortly after his marriage. Isabella, Princess of Asturias, died in childbirth and her son Miguel died at the age of two. Queen Isabella I's crowns passed to her daughter, Joanna of Castile, and her son-in-law, Philip of Habsburg. Isabella did, however, make successful dynastic matches for her three youngest daughters. The death of Isabella, Princess of Asturias, created a necessity for Manuel I of Portugal to remarry and Isabella's third child, Maria, became his next bride. Isabella's youngest daughter, Catherine, married England's Arthur, Prince of Wales, but his early death resulted in her being married to his younger brother, Henry VIII of England.  Isabella officially withdrew from governmental affairs on 14 September 1504 and she died that same year on 26 November in Medina del Campo, but it is said that she had truly been in decline since the death of her son Prince John in 1497. She is entombed in Granada in the Capilla Real, which was built by her grandson, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (Carlos I of Spain), alongside her husband Ferdinand, her daughter Joanna and Joanna's husband Philip; and Isabella's 2-year old grandson, Miguel (the son of Isabella's daughter, also named Isabella, and King Manuel I of Portugal). The museum next to the Capilla Real holds her crown and scepter. Appearance and personality. Isabella was short but of strong stocky build, of a very fair complexion, and had blue eyes, and had a hair color that was between reddish-blonde and auburn. Her daughters, Joanna and Catherine, were thought to resemble her the most. Isabella maintained an austere, temperate lifestyle, and her religious spirit influenced her the most in life. In spite of her hostility towards the Muslims in Andalusia which now is Spain and Portugal, Isabella developed a taste for Moorish decor and style. Of her, contemporaries said: Family. Isabella and Ferdinand had seven children. Five survived infancy and lived to adulthood: Towards the end of her life family tragedies overwhelmed her, although she met these reverses with grace and fortitude. The death of her beloved son and heir and the miscarriage of his wife, the death of her daughter Isabella and Isabella's son Miguel (who could have united the kingdoms of the Catholic Monarchs with that of Portugal), the madness of her daughter Joanna and the indifference of Philip the Handsome, and the uncertainty Catherine was in after the death of her husband submerged her in profound sadness that made her dress in black for the rest of her lifetime. Her strong spirituality is well understood from the words she said after hearing of her son’s death: “The Lord gave him to me, the Lord hath taken him from me, glory be His holy name.” Sanctity. It is important to note that Isabella's reputation for sanctity derives in large measure from an image carefully shaped and disseminated by the queen herself. In 1958 the Catholic canonical process of the Cause of Canonization of Isabella was started by Most Rev. Jose Garcia Goldaraz the Bishop of Valladolid where she died in 1504. 17 experts were appointed to investigate more than 100,000 documents in the archives of Spain and the Vatican and the merits of opening a canonical process of canonization. 3,500 of these were chosen to be included in 27 volumes. In 1970 the Commission determined that: ""A Canonical process for the canonization of Isabella the Catholic could be undertaken with a sense of security since there was not found one single act, public or private, of Queen Isabella that was not inspired by Christian and evangelical criteria; moreover there was a 'reputation of sanctity' uninterrupted for five centuries and as the investigation was progressing, it was more accentuated."" In 1972 the Process of Valladolid was officially submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican. This process was approved and Isabel was given the title ""Servant of God"" in March 1974. Arms. As Princess of Asturias, Isabella bore the undifferenced royal arms of the Crown of Castile and added the Saint John the Evangelist's eagle, an eagle displayed as single supporter. As queen, she quartered the Royal Arms of the Crown of Castile with the Royal Arms of the Crown of Aragon, she and Ferdinand II of Aragon adopted a yoke and a bundle of arrows as heraldic badges. As co-monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand used the motto ""Tanto Monta"" (), it refers their prenuptial agreement. The conquest of Granada in 1492 was symbolized by the addition enté en point of a quarter with a pomegranate for Granada (in Spanish ""Granada"" means pomegranate). There was an uncommon variant with the Saint John the Evangelist's eagle and two lions adopted as Castilian royal suppoters by John II, Isabella's father. Isabella commemorated. Isabella was the first woman to be featured on U.S. postage stamps, namely on three stamps of the Columbian Issue, also in celebration of Columbus. She appears in the 'Columbus soliciting aid of Isabella', 5-cent issue, and on the Spanish court scene replicated on the 15-cent Columbian, and on the $4 issue, in full portrait, side by side with Columbus. The $4 stamp is the only stamp of that denomination ever issued and one which collectors prize not only for its rarity (only 30,000 were printed) but its beauty, an exquisite carmine with some copies having a crimson hue. Mint specimens of this commemorative have been sold for more than $20,000. Isabella was also the first named woman to appear on a United States coin, an 1893 commemorative quarter, celebrating the 400th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage. Depiction in film and books.

wikipedia-23909629," Kartvelian languages  The Kartvelian languages () (also known as South Caucasian) are a language family native to the Caucasus and spoken primarily in Georgia, with large groups of native speakers in Russia, the United States, the European Union, Israel, and northeastern parts of Turkey. There are approximately 5.2 million speakers of Kartvelian languages worldwide. It is not known to be related to any other language family, making it one of the world's primary language families. The first literary source in a Kartvelian language (the inscription of Abba Antoni, composed in ancient Georgian script at the Georgian monastery near Bethlehem) dates back to 430 AD. Social and cultural status. Georgian is the official language of Georgia (spoken by 90% of the population) and the main language for literary and business use for all Kartvelian speakers in Georgia. It is written with an original and distinctive alphabet, and the oldest surviving literary text dates from the 5th century AD — the only Caucasian language that does possess an ancient literary tradition. The old Georgian script seems to have derived from Aramaic, with Greek influences. Mingrelian has been written with the Georgian alphabet since 1864, especially in the period from 1930 to 1938, when the Mingrelians enjoyed some cultural autonomy, and after 1989. The Laz language was written chiefly between 1927 and 1937, and now again in Turkey, with the Latin alphabet. Laz, however, is disappearing as its speakers are integrating into mainstream Turkish society. Classification. The Kartvelian language family consists of four languages: Genealogical tree. The older name ""South Caucasian"" is no longer much used, as it derives from the idea that Kartvelian is related to the Northwest Caucasian and Northeast Caucasian languages, a position which is no longer maintained. Higher-level connections. No relationship with other languages, including the two North Caucasian language families, has been demonstrated so far. A few linguists have proposed that the Kartvelian family is part of a much larger Nostratic language family, but both the concept of a Nostratic family and Georgian's relation to it are in doubt. Certain grammatical similarities with Basque, especially in the case system, have often been pointed out. However, these theories, which also tend to link the Caucasian languages with other non-Indo-European and non-Semitic languages of the Near East of ancient times, are generally considered to lack conclusive evidence. Any similarities to other linguistic phyla may be due to areal influences. Heavy borrowing in both directions (i.e. from North Caucasian to Kartvelian and vice versa) has been observed; therefore it is likely that certain grammatical features have been influenced as well. If the Dené–Caucasian hypothesis, which attempts to link Basque, Burushaski, the North Caucasian families and other phyla, is correct, then the similarities to Basque may also be due to these influences, however indirect. Certain Kartvelian-Indo-European lexical links are revealed at the protolanguage level, which are ascribed to the early contacts between Proto-Kartvelian and Proto-Indo-European populations. Comparative grammar. Noun classification. The Kartvelian languages classify objects as ""intelligent"" (""who""-class) and ""unintelligent"" (""what""-class) beings. Grammatical gender does not exist. Verb. Kartvelian verbs can indicate one, two, or three grammatical persons. A performer of an action is called the subject and affected persons are objects (direct or indirect). The person may be singular or plural. According to the number of persons, the verbs are classified as unipersonal, bipersonal or tripersonal. ""Subjects"" and ""objects"" are indicated with special affixes. By means of special markers Kartvelian verbs can indicate four kinds of action intentionality (""version""): "

wikipedia-23909654," Ethnic groups in Rwanda  The most prevalent ethnic groups in Rwanda are the Hutus (about 85% of the population), the Tutsis (14%), and the Twa (1%). Starting with the Tutsi feudal monarchy rule of the Tenth century, the Hutus were a subjugated social group. It was not until Belgian colonization that the tensions between the Hutus and Tutsis became focused on race, the Belgians propagating the myth that Tutsis were the superior ethnicity. The resulting tensions would eventually foster the slaughtering of Tutsis in the Rwandan genocide. Since then, government policy has changed to recognize one main ethnicity: ""Rwandan"". Pre-colonial background of Rwanda. When Europeans first explored the region around the Great Lakes of Chad that has since become Rwanda, they created an interpretation of the people found in the region as three racially distinct tribes, coexisting in a complex social order: the Tutsis, Hutus, and Twa. The Tutsis, an elite minority of about 14% of the population, were tall, slim pastoralists. The Hutu majority, about 85% of the population, were stocky, strong farmers. And the Twa were a marginalized minority of 1% of the population: a tribe of pygmies, dwelling in the forests as hunters and gatherers. Although these groups were distinct and stratified in relation to one another, the boundary between Tutsi and Hutu was somewhat open to social mobility. The Tutsi elite were defined by their exclusive ownership of land and cattle. Hutus, however, though disenfranchised socially and politically, could shed Hutuness, or ""kwihutura"", by accumulating wealth, and thereby rising through the social hierarchy to the status of Tutsi.  A contrasting picture of human cultural diversity was recorded in the early Rwandan oral histories, ritual texts, and biographies, in which the terms Tutsi, Hutu, and Twa were quite rarely used and had meanings different from those conceived by the Europeans. In those, the term Tutsi was equivalent to the phrase ""wealthy noble""; Hutu meant ""farmer""; and Twa was used to refer to people skilled in hunting, use of fire, pottery-making, guarding, etc. In contrast to the European conception, rural farmers are often described as wealthy and well-connected. Kings sometimes looked down on them but still formed marriage bonds with them and are frequently described as conferring titles, land, herds, armies, servitors, and ritual functions on them. Origin myths. Elites in pre-colonial Rwanda propagated an origin myth of the three groups to justify the hierarchical relationship of sociopolitical inequality between them in sacred, religious terms. According to this myth, Kigwa, a deity who fell from heaven, had three sons: Gatwa, Gahutu and Gatutsi. He chose an heir by giving each son the responsibility of watching over a pot of milk during the night. Gatwa drank the milk, Gahutu fell asleep and carelessly spilt his pot, and only Gatutsi kept watch, keeping his milk safe. Therefore, Kigwa appointed Gatutsi to be his successor, and Gahutu to be his brother's servant, while Gatwa was to be resigned to the status of an outsider. Gatutsi would possess cattle and power, and Gahutu would only be allowed to acquire cattle through service to Gatutsi, whereas Gatwa was condemned to the fringe of society. This myth was the basis of the hierarchical relationship that placed the Tutsi at the apex of the social pyramid: above the Hutu, who were in turn above the marginalized Twa. The prevalence of this myth became the basis of the social and political stratification of Rwanda. From the fifteenth century, when the Tutsi arrived in what is now Rwanda as migrant pastoralists, to the onset of colonization, Rwanda was a feudal monarchy. A Tutsi monarch ruled, distributing land and political authority through hereditary chiefs whose power was manifest in their land and cattle ownership. Most of these chiefs were Tutsis. The land was farmed under an imposed system of patronage under which Tutsi chiefs demanded manual labor in return for the rights of Hutus to occupy their land. This system left Hutus with the status of serfs. Additionally, when Rwanda conquered the peoples on its borders, their ethnic identities were cast aside and they were simply labeled “Hutu”. Therefore, “Hutu” became an identity that was not necessarily ethnic, but rather just associated with subjugation. Stratified social hierarchy. This social system was based on five fundamental assumptions, as reinforced through group interactions and influenced by cultural myths: Despite the stratification promulgated by these ideas, Rwanda was still very much a unified society. Notwithstanding association with different groups in the sociopolitical hierarchy, the inhabitants all considered themselves part of the same nation, the Banyarwanda, which means “people of Rwanda.” They spoke the same language, practiced the same cultural traditions, and worshiped the same God. However, the arrival of European colonizers would later exploit group divisions as a means of securing control.  The modern conception of Tutsi and Hutu as distinct ethnic groups in no way reflects the pre-colonial relationship between them. Tutsi and Hutu were simply groups occupying different places in the Rwandan social hierarchy, the division between which was exacerbated by slight differences in appearance propagated by occupation and pedigree. German and Belgian colonization. The construction of divergent ethnic “Tutsi” and “Hutu” identities was formulated during the era of European colonization from the late 1880s to the 1950s. German colonialism did little to alter the existing stratified social system. The Germans were not interested in disrupting social affairs – their sole concern was the efficient extraction of natural resources and trade of profitable cash crops. Colonial bureaucrats relied heavily on native Tutsi chiefs to maintain order over the Hutu lower classes and collect taxes. Thus, the German affirmation of the stratified social structure was utilized by the Tutsi aristocracy as justification for minority rule over the lower-class Hutu masses. Germany’s defeat in World War I allowed Belgian forces to conquer Rwanda. Belgian involvement in the region was far more intrusive than German administration. In an era of Social Darwinism, European anthropologists claimed to identify a distinct “Hamitic race” that was superior to native “Negroid” populations. Influenced by racialized attitudes, Belgian social scientists declared that the Tutsis, who wielded political control in Rwanda, must be descendants of the Hamites, who shared a purported closer blood line to Europeans. The Belgians concluded that the Tutsis and Hutus composed two fundamentally different ethno-racial groups. Thus, the Belgians viewed the Tutsis as more civilized, superior, but most importantly, more European than the Hutus. This perspective justified placing societal control in the hands of the Tutsis at the expense of the Hutus. Moreover, this Belgian affirmation of the Hamitic theory provided a conceptual foundation for Tutsis and Hutus to start identifying themselves as different ethnic groups. The Belgians established a comprehensive race theory that was to dictate Rwandan society until independence: Tutsi racial superiority and Hutu oppression. The institutionalization of Tutsi and Hutu ethnic divergence was accomplished through administrative, political economic, and educational means. Primarily, Belgian colonialism stressed physical and social differences. Relentless Belgian propaganda portrayed Tutsis as the more evolved “ethnic” group in appearance, intelligence, and height, while Hutus were branded as ignorant, backwards, and vile. Tutsis naturally welcomed this ethnic schism because thinking in these racialized terms had tangible social benefits – it vindicated their minority domination over the majority Hutus. This administrative propaganda had a subconscious effect of convincing Hutus and Tutsis that they were in fact members of separate ethnic, not social groups. For Belgian colonial elites, this was a classic “divide and conquer” strategy: cleaving groups along salient social boundaries served as a mechanism in securing colonial control over indigenous groups. Initially, Belgian administrators used an expedient method of classification based on the number of cattle a person owned – anyone with ten or more cattle was considered a member of the aristocratic Tutsi class. However, the presence of wealthy Hutu was problematic. Then in 1933, the colonial administration institutionalized a more rigid ethnic classification by issuing ethnic identification cards; every Rwandan was officially branded a Tutsi, Hutu, or Twa. Tutsi political & economic hegemony. Next, Belgian promotion of Tutsi political domination served as a prime catalyst of growing “ethnic” resentments. The Belgians dismantled Hutu kingdoms that had maintained local control in the northwest. In 1926 the Belgians abolished the local posts of “land-chief”, “cattle-chief” and “military chief,” and in doing so they stripped the Hutus of their limited local power over land. Instead, they entrenched an authoritarian Tutsi aristocracy to rule over the Hutu majorities in which Tutsis took over as provincial governors, local chieftains, and civil bureaucrats. Hutu officials were excluded from local administrative structures while Hutu chieftains were systematically denied from ruling their own people, as they had done for centuries before. The establishment of Tutsi minority rule created much bitterness among the Hutu majority, who felt disenfranchised and politically repressed. This political resentment fueled the development of an ethnic gulf between Tutsis, who wielded political power, and Hutus, who were locked out of power. Belgian economic policies also further increased the ethnic divide between Tutsis and Hutus. Colonial elites appropriated large land grants to Tutsis, displacing formerly wealthy Hutu landowners. The Belgians strengthened the feudal arrangement of Rwanda’s pre-colonial past by forcing Hutus to work on lands owned by Tutsis. Moreover, Tutsis were appointed as trade officials and tax collectors, further reinforcing Tutsi economic hegemony over the Hutus. Colonial policies deepened the pre-existing class stratification: Tutsis were primarily upper-class wealthy landowners and merchants, while Hutus occupied lower-class occupations as poor farmers and laborers. These deep class differences provided a framework for mapping ethnic identities on top of them: class-hatred was a prominent tool for fueling divergent ethno-nationalist ideologies. Thus, this socioeconomic stratification was a chief driver in formulating both ethnic identities: the oppression of the Hutus by the Tutsis served as a key catalyst in forming a common Hutu identity among the exploited lower classes, while the Tutsi economic supremacy over the Hutus served as a key catalyst in shaping a singular Tutsi identity among the privileged upper classes. Lastly, the education system reinforced the bifurcation of Tutsi and Hutu ethnic identity. The Roman Catholic Church, the primary educators in the country, subscribed to the differences between Hutus and Tutsis by developing separate educational systems for each. Not surprisingly, in the 1940s and 1950s, the vast majority of students were Tutsis, even though the majority of Rwandans now self-identified as Hutus. Hutu race theory. The sum totality of these colonial measures fashioned a resentful inferiority complex among the Hutus. Although the Hamitic theory was jointly utilized by the Belgians and the Tutsis to systematically oppress the Hutu, the Hutu themselves internalized the hypothesis and flipped it around as a framework for viewing the Tutsi. Hutu intellectuals re-framed the race theory as a defense mechanism: Hutu inferiority evolved into rightful supremacy in Rwanda, while Tutsi superiority evolved into an illegitimate foreignness to rule in Rwanda. Tutsis were viewed not as the rightful rulers that the Belgians claimed they were, but as foreigners from northeast Africa who invaded “rightful” Hutu territories. This Hutu reconstruction of the myth of Tutsi foreignness was disseminated and propagated as a reaction to “unjust” Tutsi rule. The ethnic security dilemma. Other theoretical frameworks can also explain the construction of ethnic divergence between Tutsis and Hutus. First, the creation of salient ethnic identities can be seen as a better mechanism of capturing class resentment on the part of Hutus; layering an ethnic dimension over class identities was a better strategy for mobilizing the masses and legitimizing resistance against upper-class, ethnically different Tutsis. Second, a reworking of Michael Mann’s security dilemma in the Rwandan case produces the “ethnic” security dilemma: Hutus perceived that the Tutsis were forming a distinct ethnic identity, pushed by the Belgians, to legitimize political control. Whether or not this perception was true, as Mann’s classic security dilemma maintains, Hutus responded to this supposed “ethnic attack” by forming their own ethnic identity. In reaction to being labeled the superior ethnic group by the Belgians and in the face of rising Hutu ethnicity, the Tutsis actually accepted and internalized this ethnic label, promoting Tutsi ethnic identity as a defense. This ethnic security dilemma model is a feasible theoretical explanation for the construction of divergent ethnic identities. Identifying when in historical time these social group differences became ethnic differences is hard to pinpoint. There was no one crystallization point. The long process of constructing ethnicity, however, continued and strengthened in post-colonial years. Post-colonial framework. As Belgium’s era of colonial dominance over Rwanda drew to a close during the 1950s, the Hutu and Tutsi, as racial identities, had been firmly institutionalized. Manipulative racial engineering by the Belgians, and the despotic practices of the Tutsi chieftains they empowered, helped drive together the disparate Rwandan sub-classes under the “Hutu” moniker. When the Belgians were to finally leave Rwanda in the early years of the 1960s, the politics of racial and ethnic division remained. And in the following decades, regimes under both Hutu ultra-nationalists and moderate conciliators would demonstrate how the labels of Hutu and Tutsi could be molded and twisted to fit political expediency. Racialization of Hutu and Tutsi identities Under Kayibanda. Despite their systematic oppression, a class of Hutu political intelligentsia influenced by contemporary communist thought emerged, forming a stance against elite rule of the proletariat masses, which was reinterpreted as Tutsi rule over the Hutu. This Hutu counter-elite exploded onto the political scene in the late 1950s as both Belgian colonial influence and their firm support of the Tutsi minority declined. The emerging Hutu counter-elite provided a voice to the majority “Hutu” people, via a series of political proclamations and, later, sweeping electoral victories. Yet the voice that emerged was one embittered by decades of subjugation; one which championed Hutu nationalism and anti-Tutsi sentiment. The result was a “Hutu political consciousness” driven by populist and nationalistic forces, with the goal of dethroning the privileged Tutsi and driving a deeper wedge between their peoples. In 1957, these Hutu nationalist elites made their political debut when a UN mission to the region was greeted with two declarations of independence by the Rwandan people. The first, a proclamation by the Mwami’s (king’s) high council proposed a rapid transfer of power from the Belgians to the Tutsi royal leadership. Called Mise au Point, the document emphasized the importance of ending racial tensions between white colonizers and black colonials. One month later, the Hutu political elites responded with their own declaration, the “Bahutu Manifesto”. This document called for a double liberation of the Hutu people, first from the race of white colonials, and second from the race of Hamitic oppressors, the Tutsi. The document in many ways established the future tone of the Hutu nationalist movement by identifying the “indigenous racial problem” of Rwanda as the social, political, and economic “monopoly which is held by one race, the Tutsi.” The manifesto also served as a prescient omen that future political identities in Rwanda would be defined along racial identities. At the beginning of the Social Revolution of 1959 two years later, four major political parties emerged: two Tutsi monarchist parties, Union Nationale Rwandaise (UNAR) and Rassemblement Democratique Rwandais (RADER), and two Hutu parties, the nationalist Mouvement Democratique Rwandais / Parti du Mouvement et de L’Emancipacion Hutu (MDR-PARMEHUTU), and the moderate constitutionalists L’Association pour la Promotion Sociale de la Masse (APROSOMA). This marked the first time in Rwandan history that such stark party identification had emerged along exclusively ethnic lines. Not all parties championed segregation of the Hutu and Tutsi people, yet the divide ensured that the socio-political differentiation pioneered under colonialism would continue to flourish in independence. In the ensuing provisional elections, the nationalist party of Grégoire Kayibanda (MDR-PARMEHUTU) rose to the fore. This victory gave PARMEHUTU an apparent mandate to initiate their program of segregation and discrimination against the Tutsi. Soon, Kayibanda would find the political cover he needed to consolidate control over Rwandan politics and excise the Tutsi from the political arena. In November and December 1963, a series of small cross border raids were carried out by expatriated Tutsi who had fled Rwanda between 1959 and 1963, during the tumultuous rise of Hutu nationalist politics. These exiles, publicly termed the ""inyenzi"", (“cockroaches”) by Kayibandi, were portrayed by the Hutu government as different from the domestic Tutsi only by the extremism of their political beliefs, and thus domestic Tutsi were often suspected of being collaborators in the raids. Building on this suspicion, PARMEHUTU overtly demonized and excised the Tutsi minority, politically and socially, in the wake of the 1963 raids. Disorganized reprisal killings against Tutsi were carried out at the local level, with minimal government intervention. Kayibandi, meanwhile, ordered the execution of almost two dozen leading moderate Tutsi political figures, effectively decapitating the domestic Tutsi opposition parties. This left the extremist Tutsi in exile as the only remaining Tutsi political force in the region, and prime targets for future demonization. By the end of 1963, PARMEHUTU had established its political supremacy in Rwanda, with Kayibanda as president. Also established, in the public view, was the ever-present threat of external Tutsi invasion, the suspicion of which often translated to reprisals against the domestic Tutsi population. By 1964, Kayibandi had stepped in to quell the reprisal killings, but the sociopolitical position of the Tutsi minority continued to diminish. Under the ensuing decade of PARMEHUTU rule, all Tutsi were removed from public office, their enrollment in the public education system was curtailed, and they were relegated to second-class citizen status. Perhaps most importantly, the government continued, via official literature and the public education system, to characterize the Hutu/Tutsi divide as racial in nature, not ethnic. The purpose of this distinction was that, via a “racial” differentiation, Tutsi could be characterized as alien, non-indigenous, and thus not genuine Rwandan nationals; whereas ethnic differentiations could perceivably exist within a single national identity. Under Kayibanda, domestic Tutsi were viewed not as Rwandan citizens by the Hutu government, but as domestic aliens to be tolerated; participatory in civil life, yet removed from the political sphere and from its corresponding rights and protections. Ethnization of Hutu/Tutsi identity under Habyarimana. In July 1973 a Tutsi massacre of Hutu elites in neighboring Burundi triggered another flare-up of domestic racial tension in Rwanda, in which domestic Tutsi were again blamed for the actions of their foreign “counterparts.” As was the case in 1963, political and physical reprisals were initiated against domestic Tutsis, beginning with the black-listing of Tutsi students from state universities, and spreading to broader society. Eventually, domestic violence and disruption became so severe that Major General Juvénal Habyarimana led the army in a coup, overthrowing the nationalistic PARMEHUTU regime and establishing the second republic. The second republic, a single-party military regime under Habyarimana, sought to roll back the racializing policies of his predecessor responsible for domestic discord. The Hutu/Tutsi divide was reclassified by the government as “ethnic,” not racial, and the moratorium on Tutsi government participation was lifted (but Tutsi participation in government remained low. Quota systems were established for ethnic participation in education and public sector jobs; attempting to proportionally distribute participation between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. In this case, however, participation for the historically better educated Tutsi remained inflated. In his stated quest to redress historical wrongs, Habyarimana committed the government to a policy of “reconciliation.” However, a reclassification of the Hutu/Tutsi differentiation from racial to ethnic was not equivalent to a repudiation of the differentiation itself, and discrimination was still prevalent in society and policy. Although the “Tutsi” were defined by the state as an ethnic minority, they were denied recognition as a protected minority and remained conspicuously absent from elected offices.  Some vestiges of the old regime remained codified as well, such as the law that Hutu military officials were not allowed to marry Tutsi women. As well, Habyarimana assured the Hutu majority that a Hutu leader would always be the “leader and protector” of the republic. Thus, Juvénal Habyarimana still defined the terms of the “reconciliation” as Tutsis remained politically subservient under his regime. Perhaps most insidiously, however, was how the transition to the Habyarimana regime illustrated the ease and means by which Rwandan national regimes could redraw and manipulate the racial/ethnic divisions of their own people in order to fit their own political agendas. Despite years of relative peace following the formation of the 2nd republic, Habyarimana’s goals of reconciliation ultimately failed. Hutu/Tutsi differences remained codified in law. When Habyarimana’s government began the transition to a democratic system in the late 1980s, it was perhaps inevitable that divisions would manifest once again along Hutu/Tutsi lines. As well, popular Hutu resentment at the disproportional representation of Tutsi in the quota system meant that friction between the groups never truly dissipated. Some political scientists credit these failures as a few of the reasons why Rwanda so quickly slipped back into political turmoil along ethnic lines in the years immediately preceding the 1993 genocide. Ethnic identity cards in contemporary Rwanda. In the 1930s Rwanda’s Belgian administration issued identity cards—a policy that would remain for over a half-a-century and one that would not create ethnicity, but instead would ensure its social salience. These instruments of documentation would be key in fomenting Rwanda’s devastating genocide in 1994. During the early 1990s the Hutus—who comprised a significant majority of the Rwandan population—were being manipulated as political tools by President Juvénal Habyarimana’s regime. Under an imposed order to democratize, Habyarimana rallied the majority Hutus against what he depicted as their racial enemy—the Tutsis—in a measure to prevent both regional and class division from becoming politically relevant issues. Thus, this political climate ensured that national identity would be defined singularly across ethnic lines—a dangerous prelude to the ensuing genocide. The tense situation became inflamed with Habyarimana’s mysterious death in 1994. Quickly, Hutu administration implemented a policy to kill any and all Tutsi—a process believed to be simplified by identity cards. Flexibility of ethnic identification. Identity cards became the subject of paranoia as this form of identification allowed the reinvention of personal identity through illegal forging; during the genocide, “mistakes” were often made because of this flexibility in identity. In particular, because a Rwandan’s ethnic identity was solely traced through paternal lineage, there was considerable difficulty in establishing true paternity. Furthermore, inter-marriage particularly in the Southern region of the country furthered suspicion over Hutu or Tutsi paternity. Though forging was rare, the doubt over ethnic identity served as proof that unlike the rhetoric of Rwandan government, and that of the preceding Belgian colonizers, ethnicity was not primordialist in nature. Instead, ethnicity was a socially-constructed, superimposed identity that could potentially be changed, regardless of identity card issuance. The end of the genocide resulted in the election of a Tutsi government—the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). This shift in power provided the minority Tutsi with access to power and privilege, completely shifting social conceptions. Attempts to re-build the war-torn country focused on eclipsing identity for fear that retaliation and punishment towards the Hutus would occur. The government’s agenda thus was to reduce identity to that of just being “Rwandan”. In this post-genocide society, identity was supposedly re-conceptualized to divert the emphasis from ethnicity to a division of the population into categories of victim, victors, survivors, and perpetrators. New social identities. However, in identifying victims and survivors, some Rwandans are left to be identified as perpetrators. This becomes increasingly problematic as all Hutus are deemed perpetrators—where their survival of the genocide seems to imply some form of complicity with the former government. Thus, in this process of rebuilding and bringing guilty parties to justice, the current government is providing dangling linkages back to the very ethnicities they wish to abolish and is risking further entrenching supposed “past” ethnic divisions. Furthermore, government policy to reduce identity to “just a Rwandan one” has only “been successful in the public sphere of government rhetoric and bureaucracy.” In fact, ethnicity still remains socially relevant. Its salience however has been transferred into the private sphere—a space that may make the divisions even more destructive. Thus, the concept of “eliminating” ethnicity is problematic in both concept and reality—as it is unreasonable to expect such a drastic change in the Rwandan perception. "

wikipedia-23909907," Arsenal F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry  The Arsenal F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry is a notable rivalry in English football as both clubs are recognised as having great history and traditions. Although the two clubs have frequently been in the same division as each other since 1919, the rivalry has largely arisen since around 1990. Many of the clashes in recent times between the two teams in the late 1990s and early 2000s have been due to the teams being fierce rivals for the Premier League and FA Cup. There is also enmity between English football's longest serving managers, Arsenal's Arsène Wenger and United's Sir Alex Ferguson, and their former club captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane. The rivalry has been noted for on-field trouble, particularly the contests in 1990, cumulating in 2003 and 2004. In recent years with Manchester United being less competitive, the rivalry has dimished somewhat, according to former Arsenal player Lee Dixon, while Manchester United has also stated that the two teams have cooled from those ""heated"" exchanges. Origins. A particularly memorable match between the two sides came on 1 February 1958, when they met in a league fixture at Highbury – the last league game that United played before the Munich air disaster five days later, which claimed the lives of eight of their players and saw two other players injured to such an extent that they never played again. United won the game 5–4, with goals from Tommy Taylor (twice), Duncan Edwards, Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet. Five of the United players who would lose their lives as a result of crash took to the field in the game – captain and full-back Roger Byrne, right-half Eddie Colman, centre-half Mark Jones, left-half Duncan Edwards and centre-forward Tommy Taylor. Although the two clubs had previously contested many important matches, such as the 1979 FA Cup Final, the rivalry is generally perceived to have begun with a notorious match at Old Trafford on 20 October 1990, which resulted in both clubs being docked points in the 1990–91 First Division. Alex Ferguson has stated that he believes that the rivalry predates this by a few years, however, to a match in January 1987 when David Rocastle was sent off for retaliating against a foul by Norman Whiteside. Another high profile clash came more than 20 years later, in the final of the FA Cup on 12 May 1979. A 100,000-strong crowd saw Arsenal take a 2–0 lead in the first half thanks to goals from Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton, and with just five minutes left on the clock their lead was still intact. Then, in the 86th minute, Gordon McQueen pulled a goal back for United, and two minutes later they equalised with a goal from Sammy McIlroy. However, barely a minute after United equalised, Arsenal's Alan Sunderland scored a last-gasp goal to win the cup 3–2 for Arsenal. 1989 to 2009. On 19 August 1989, at the beginning of Alex Ferguson's fourth season as Manchester United manager (and with the club still yet to win any silverware under his management), defending league champions Arsenal travelled to Old Trafford for the first league game of the season. United won 4–1 with goals from Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes, Brian McClair and new signing Neil Webb, with Arsenal's consolation goal being scored by David Rocastle. Arsenal finished the season fourth in the league with 62 points, putting them 17 points adrift of champions Liverpool. Although United had a disappointing season in the league, finishing 13th (five points and five places clear of the relegation zone), they ended the season as winners of the FA Cup. In 1990–91, Arsenal won the second of their league titles under the management of George Graham, losing just one of their 38 league games all season. They sealed their title on 6 May 1991, just before the kick-off in their league game against United at Highbury, which they went on to win 3–1. Their title was confirmed without kicking a ball as their last remaining challengers Liverpool had been defeated by Nottingham Forest earlier in the day. The season had already seen two high profile clashes between United and Arsenal – one being the ill-tempered league clash at Old Trafford on 20 October, the other in the Football League Cup just over a month later. The two clubs were drawn to play at Highbury in the fourth round tie on 28 November 1990. United won the tie 6–2, with 19-year-old winger Lee Sharpe scoring a hat-trick. Another key point in this rivalry was during the 2003–04 Premier League season. During this year, Arsenal went on to win the league with an unbeaten record. They were labeled as ""The Invincibles"" and during their first game with Manchester United, they drew 0–0 at Old Trafford in a match dubbed the ""Battle of Old Trafford"". Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira was sent off in the 80th minute for two bookable offences and in second half stoppage time, Gunners defender Martin Keown brought down United's Diego Forlán in the Arsenal penalty area, Ruud van Nistelrooy stepped up for the spot kick but his shot rebounded off the crossbar. This was followed by scenes of jubilation from the Arsenal players, especially Martin Keown who confronted van Nistelrooy after his miss. The resulting scuffle led to another fracas after the final whistle, which ended up with four players from both sides being given yellow cards. The next game between these two clubs was held at Highbury, which resulted in a 1–1 tie. At the end of the season, Arsenal ended with 90 points while Manchester United finished with 75 points in the third position. Arsenal eclipsed Manchester United and truly began a hatred between the two clubs. Even famous arguments and fights occurred between players, such as Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane. Arsenal went on to hold a national record of 49 games unbeaten, which was ended by a game with Manchester United. This game was later called ""Battle of the Buffet"". This match was a huge catalyst in the ongoing rivalry of these two clubs. The 2005 FA Cup Final, between the two sides, was the first time in the competition's history that the final was decided on a penalty shoot-out. Arsenal beat United 5–4, following a goalless draw after extra time. Arsenal forward José Antonio Reyes became the second player in Cup Final history to be sent off, following his second yellow card near the end of extra time. Recent years. With Chelsea's back-to-back Premiership titles in 2004-05 and 2005-06 under José Mourinho, the United-Arsenal rivalry has cooled somewhat. United manager Alex Ferguson was heard remarking before the 6 May 2007 game between Arsenal and Chelsea that he was rooting for ""The Gunners"", a game where Arsenal held Chelsea to a draw which clinched the title for United.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6602893.stm][http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6603119.stm] In December 2010, United manager Alex Ferguson made a personal plea to the United fans to no longer sing a ""sick"" chant at Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger, as those kind of chants from fans were considered an embarrassment to Manchester United. With both teams going for the Premier League title in May 2011, Arsenal won their first game against Manchester United since November 2008, to leave United just three points ahead of Chelsea and six ahead of Arsenal going into the final three games of the season. Nevertheless, United won the league, nine points ahead of Chelsea and twelve points ahead of Arsenal. In August 2011, Arsenal suffered their heaviest league defeat in 84 years as they lost 8–2 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Arsenal had not lost a league game by such a margin since 1927 when they lost 7–0 to West Ham United in the old Football League First Division. This was also the first time they had conceded eight goals in a game since 1896, when they lost 8–0 to the now defunct Loughborough F.C. in the old Football League Second Division. In August 2012, then-Arsenal captain Robin van Persie transferred to Manchester United after stating that he would not renew his contract with Arsenal. Van Persie was in incredible form, after years of being very injury prone. It was speculated that he would move to a club overseas, as a sign of respect for his former club, but eventually, he controversially signed for Manchester United. In recent years, Wenger has publicly paid tribute to Ferguson's long success with United, saying “I don’t remember anybody else being at the top, top level for such a long time. In some ways it is scary as well because you think when this guy leaves the club, no matter of the quality of who comes in after him, it will be a huge hole. The club will be destabilised even if the guy who comes after him is top quality because the print of everything, the life of everything, revolves around Ferguson so much at Manchester United. He has to be immortal so the club doesn’t suffer! His commitment is always there, you never feel that his commitment is weakened. What I admire maybe the most in him is his forward-thinking. He is always ready to move with the times and never speaks about what he has done before. He knows when to renew the team, when you have to make changes, and that is exceptional because you can sometimes be a little bit lazy when you have so much success. He’s never been like that, he’s always on his toes and he can renew what is needed, when it is needed. It is a job where you need to dedicate your life to football and Ferguson has done that and that deserves massive respect. He has won absolutely everything and, of course, that is something exceptional.”Ferguson also defended Wenger as indispensable to Arsenal and being correct to sell Cesc Fábregas and Samir Nasri, saying ""I would like to know who is going to replace him. The work he has done in the 15 years he has been at the club is the best in Arsenal's history. Yes, he has not won a trophy for six years but what does that mean? The quality of his side has not been reduced. The competition is far greater now. When Arsenal and ourselves were going head-to-head, that went on for about eight years. It is a bit unfair of course, but who understands fairness and unfairness today? It is quite a cynical world. Supporters are far less easy to please than they were 20 years ago. But Arsenal answered everybody back on Wednesday [beating Udinese to qualify for the Champions League. A lot of people thought they would go out. I didn't. I thought they would win it. The game on Sunday will be another stepping stone for them.""[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/aug/26/alex-ferguson-defends-arsene-wenger] Crossing the divide. Arsenal, then Manchester United.

wikipedia-23910198," Seiðr  Seiðr (sometimes anglicized as ""seidhr"", ""seidh"", ""seidr"", ""seithr"" or ""seith"") is an Old Norse term for a type of sorcery which was practised in Norse society during the Late Scandinavian Iron Age. Connected with Norse religion, its origins are largely unknown, although it gradually eroded following the Christianization of Scandinavia. Accounts of ""seiðr"" later made it into sagas and other literary sources, while further evidence has been unearthed by archaeologists. Various scholars have debated the nature of ""seiðr"", some arguing that it was shamanic in context, involving visionary journeys by its practitioners. ""Seiðr"" practitioners were of both genders, although females are more widely attested, with such sorceresses being variously known as ""vǫlur"", ""seiðkonur"" and ""vísendakona"". There were also accounts of male practitioners, known as ""seiðmenn"", but in practising magic they brought a social taboo, known as ""ergi"", on to themselves, and were sometimes persecuted as a result. In many cases these magical practitioners would have had assistants to aid them in their rituals. Within pre-Christian Norse mythology, ""seiðr"" was associated with both the god Oðinn, a deity who was simultaneously responsible for war, poetry and sorcery, as well as the goddess Freyja, a member of the Vanir who was believed to have taught the practice to the Æsir. In the 20th century, adherents of various modern pagan new religious movements adopted forms of magico-religious practice that they have referred to as ""seiðr"". The practices of these contemporary ""seiðr""-workers have since been investigated by various academic researchers operating in the field of pagan studies. Terminology and etymology. The etymology of seiðr is unclear, but related words in Old High German (see German Saite, used both in string instruments and in bows) and Old English are related to ""cord, string,"" or ""snare, cord, halter"" and there is a line in verse 15 of the skaldic poem Ragnarsdrápa that uses seiðr in that sense. However, it is not clear how this derivation relates to the practice of seiðr. It has been suggested that the use of a cord in attraction may be related to seiðr, where attraction is one element of the practice of seiðr magic described in Norse literature and with witchcraft in Scandinavian folklore. However, if seiðr involved ""spinning charms"", that would explain the distaff, a tool used in spinning flax or sometimes wool, that appears to be associated with seiðr practice. Old English terms cognate with seiðr are ""siden"" and ""sidsa"", both of which are attested only in contexts which suggest that they were used by elves (""ælfe""); these seem likely to have meant something similar to seiðr. Among the Old English words for practitioners of magic are ""wicca"" (m.) or ""wicce"" (f.), the etymons of Modern English ""witch"". Seiðr involved the incantation of spells (galðrar, sing. ""galðr"") and possibly a circular dance. Practitioners of seiðr were predominantly women (vǫlva or ""seiðkona"" ""seiðr woman""), although there were male practitioners (""seiðmaðr"" ""seiðr-man"") as well. These female practitioners were religious leaders of the Viking community and usually required the help of other practitioners to invoke their deities, gods or spirits. The seiðr ritual required not just the powers of a female spiritual medium but of the spiritual participation of other women within the Norse community: it was a communal effort. As they are described in a number of other Scandinavian sagas, Saga of Erik the Red in particular, the female practitioners connected with the spiritual realm through chanting and prayer. Viking texts suggest that the seiðr ritual was used in times of inherent crisis, as a tool used in the process of seeing into the future, and for cursing and hexing one's enemies. With that said, it could have been used for great good or destructive evil, as well as for daily guidance. Old Norse literature. In the Viking Age, the practice of seid by men had connotations of unmanliness or effeminacy, known as ergi, as its manipulative aspects ran counter to masculine ideal of forthright, open behavior. Freyja and perhaps some of the other goddesses of Norse mythology were seiðr practitioners, as was Oðinn, a fact for which he is taunted by Loki in the Lokasenna. Sagas. Eric the Red. In the 13th century ""Saga of Eric the Red"", there was a ""seiðkona"" or ""vǫlva"" in Greenland named Thorbjǫrg (""Protected by Thor""). She wore a blue cloak and a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white cat skin, carried the symbolic distaff (""seiðstafr""), which was buried with her, and would sit on a high platform. As related in the Saga: Other sagas. As described by Snorri Sturluson in his Ynglinga saga, seiđr includes both divination and manipulative magic. It seems likely that the type of divination of seiđr-practitioners was generally distinct, by dint of an altogether more metaphysical nature, from the day-to-day auguries performed by the seers (""menn framsýnir"", ""menn forspáir""). However, in the Icelandic sage Ǫrvar-Oddr, the ""seiđkona""'s cloak is black but she also carries a distaff, which allegedly had the power of causing forgetfulness in one who is tapped three times on the cheek by it. Practices. Price noted that, because of its connection with ergi, seidr was undoubtedly located on 'one of society's moral and psychological borders'. Sex magic. Certain aspects of seiðr were sexual in nature, leading Neil Price to argue that it was very likely that it actually involved sexual acts. Various scholars have argued that the staff used by seiðr practitioners may have been used as an imitation penis. As evidence, they have highlighted the fact that the staffs have phallic epithets in various Icelandic sagas. Mythology. Oðinn and ""Seiðr"". British archaeologist Neil Price noted that ""the realm of sorcery"" was present in Oðinn's many aspects. In Lokasenna, Loki accuses Oðinn of practising seiðr, condemning it as an unmanly art (""ergi""). A justification for this may be found in the ""Ynglinga saga"", where Snorri opines that following the practice of seiðr rendered the practitioner weak and helpless. One possible example of seiðr in Norse mythology is the prophetic vision given to Oðinn in the Vǫluspá by the ""vǫlva"" after whom the poem is named. Her vision is not connected explicitly with seiðr; however, the word occurs in the poem in relation to a character called Heiðr (who is traditionally associated with Freyja but may be identical with the vǫlva). The interrelationship between the vǫlva in this account and the Norns, the fates of Norse lore, is strong and striking. Another noted mythological practitioner of seiðr was Gróa, who attempted to assist Thor, and who in the Svipdagsmál in a poem entitled Grógaldr ""Gróa's spell"" is summoned from beyond the grave. Freyja and ""Seiðr"". Like Oðinn, the Norse goddess Freyja is also associated with 'seiðr' in the surviving literature. In the ""Ynglinga saga"" (c.1225), written by Icelandic poet Snorri Sturluson, it is stated that ""seiðr"" had originally been a practice among the Vanir, but that Freyja, who was herself a member of the Vanir, had introduced it to the Æsir when she joined them. Freyja is identified in ""Ynglinga saga"" as an adept of the mysteries of seiðr, and it is said that it was she who taught it to Oðinn:Dóttir Njarðar var Freyja. Hon var blótgyðja. Hon kenndi fyrst með Ásum seið, sem Vǫnum var títt.""Njǫrðr’s daughter was Freyja. She presided over the sacrifice. It was she who first acquainted the Æsir with seiðr, which was customary among the Vanir."" Origins. Since the publication of Jacob Grimm's socio-linguistical Deutsches Wörterbuch (p. 638) in 1835, scholarship draws a Balto-Finnic link to seiðr, citing the depiction of its practitioners as such in the sagas and elsewhere, and linking seiðr to the practices of the noaidi, the patrilineal shamans of the Sami people. However, Indo-European origins are also possible. Note that the Finnish word ""seita"" and the Sami variants of the term ""sieidde"" refer to a human-shaped tree or a large and strangely-shaped stone or rock and do not necessarily reference magical power. There is a good case, however, that these words do derive ultimately from seiðr. Jordanes, in his De Origine Actibusque Getarum ""Origins and Deeds of the Goths"" gives an account of the origins of the Huns from the union of witches with ""unclean spirits"". These witches are said to have been expelled from the army of the Goths by king Filimer (fl. late 2nd century). Jordanes gives the Gothic name of these ' as ' (sg. ""*""). Old English has ' (f. ') ""witch"". Old High German has """" ""necromancy"". Contemporary Paganism. Contemporary Paganism, also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an umbrella term used to identify a wide variety of new religious movements, particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various pagan beliefs of premodern Europe. Several of these contemporary pagan religions draw specifically on the original mediaeval religious beliefs and practices of Anglo-Saxon England as sources of inspiration, adopting such Anglo-Saxon deities as their own. Seiðr is interpreted differently by different groups and practitioners, but usually taken to indicate altered consciousness or even total loss of physical control. Diana L. Paxson and her group ""Hrafnar"" have attempted reconstructions of seiðr (particularly the oracular form) from historical material. Jan Fries regards seiðr as a form of ""shamanic trembling"", which he relates to ""seething"", used as a shamanic technique, the idea being his own and developed through experimentation. According to Blain, seiðr is an intrinsic part of spiritual practice connecting practitioners to the wider cosmology in British Germanic Neopaganism. References. Bibliography.

wikipedia-23910367," Tin-Tin Kyrano  Tin-Tin Kyrano is a character in the mid-1960s British television show ""Thunderbirds"". In the original TV series and its original movie adaptations, Tin-Tin, like the other characters, is portrayed using a marionette, and Christine Finn provided her voice. Tin-Tin is the daughter of Kyrano, an old friend of Jeff Tracy and joins the International Rescue team shortly after they begin operating. Ironically, Tin-Tin becomes involved in their first rescue mission when she is onboard Fireflash which due to sabotage by her half uncle The Hood has to be rescued by International Rescue. Tin-Tin has a variety of roles on Tracy Island from playing secretary to Jeff (""Terror In New York City""), laboratory and engineering assistant to Brains (""City Of Fire"", ""Danger At Ocean Deep"") and sometimes accompanies International Rescue on their missions, most notably the rescue of the Sun probe spaceship (""Sun Probe""). She is also known to accompany Lady Penelope on espionage missions (""The Cham Cham""). Broadcasts of fictional programs in Japan typically include subtitles introducing the names of characters when they first appear on screen. The actor's names are listed underneath, when live characters are involved. Tin-Tin, however, is introduced as Min-Min. This is because there is no character in Japanese for ""ti"", and ""chi"" is usually substituted instead. However, chin-chin is a Japanese colloquialism for the male phallus, which is a wholly inappropriate name for a teenage girl. Tin-Tin is romantically involved with Alan Tracy, though her feelings for Alan were clouded when an old flame Eddie Houseman came to visit (""End Of The Road""). In the 2004 live action film ""Thunderbirds"" which was loosely based on the TV series, she is played by Vanessa Hudgens, although the character of Tin-Tin is much younger and is no longer Malaysian but depicted as being from India. In the film, she also has a mother, Onaha. Also she is shown to have the same kind of powers as her uncle, the Hood. She also (later in the film) is shown to suffer the same weakening side-effect. "

wikipedia-23910513," No homo  The phrases no homo and pause are slang terms. They parenthetically assert that the speaker of such does not have any homosexual intent and are usually used after an utterance that may have given that impression. History. The term ""no homo"" originated in East Harlem slang of the early 1990s. It was used by many to distance themselves from the stereotype of closeted gay and bisexual men. Criticism. Several social commentators have criticized the use of both ""no homo"" and ""pause"" in hip hop and in the mainstream. It has been said that the phrases ""uphold an unhealthy relationship with homosexuality, a relationship based in fear."" Fox News commentator Marc Lamont Hill encouraged the hip-hop community to stop using ""no homo"" in its music. At the same time, ""Slate"" columnist Jonah Weiner suggested the use of the phrase is somewhat more complex. Weiner notes several hip hop artistssuch as Cam'ron and Lil Waynecultivate an extravagant and camp public persona while embracing homophobia, thus saying ""no homo"" can help expand established concepts of masculinity, and challenge the status quo. Nick Catucci, writing for ""New York"" magazine, disagrees with this assessment. In his view, ""no homo"" is merely another form of gay bashing, and to a large extent is used simply because it ""just sounds good"", and is easily applicable in rhymes. A rapper like Cam'ron, Catucci argues, will use the phrase and dress in pink simply to show that he is man enough to get away with it, without being suspected of being gay. "

The act increased the area of Berlin from to and the population from 1.9 million to 4 million. Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin is home to about 250,000 Turks (especially in Kreuzberg, Neukölln and Wedding, a locality in the borough of Mitte), making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. In the 1990s the ""Aussiedlergesetze"" enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former Soviet Union. Today ethnic Germans from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community. The current decade experiences an increasing influx from various Western countries. Especially young EU-Europeans are settling in the city. Additionally, Berlin has seen a rise of African immigrants during the last two decades. In December 2010, 457,806 residents (13.5% of the population) were of foreign nationality, originating from 190 different countries.  Statistics. As of 2010, there were approx. 900,000 (approx. 27%) persons with a migrant background resident in Berlin. However, there are significant differences in the distribution of minorities. For instance, in the West-Berlin areas of Wedding, Neukölln and Berlin-Gesundbrunnen, foreign nationals and German nationals with a migrant background make up nearly 70% of the population, whereas areas and localities in former East Berlin have much lower percentages. The immigrant community is quite diverse, however, Middle Easterners (e.g. Turks, Arabs etc.), Eastern Europeans and smaller numbers of East Asians, Sub-Saharan Africans and other European immigrants form the largest groups. Approximately 70,000 Afro-Germans live in Berlin. Furthermore, there are more than 25 non-indigenous communities and nationalities which have a population of at least 10,000 people such as Turkish, Polish, Russian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Serbian, Italian, Bosnian, Vietnamese, US-American, Romanian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Austrian, Ghanaian, Ukrainian, French, British, Spanish, Israeli, Thai, Iranian, Egyptian, Syrian etc. The lists are based on official statistics regarding the foreign background of Berlin residents and not primarily on ethnicity; hence, there might be a lower percentage of Germans without a migrant background/ethnic Germans. The percentage of children and teenagers who have a migrant background is 50%. In Neukölln it is nearly 80%. Additionally, Berlin has up to 100,000 to 250,000 illegal immigrants. Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union, there has been an influx of Romani people. Local social welfare offices are attempting to integrate them and other migrants with German-language and job-skill courses. The most common foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Russian, Arabic, Polish, Kurdish, Vietnamese, English, Serbian, Croatian, Greek and other Asian languages. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Serbian and Croatian can be heard more often in the western part, due to the large Middle-Eastern and ex-Yugoslavian immigrant communities, whereas Vietnamese, Russian and Polish have more native speakers residing in the eastern part of Berlin.

wikipedia-24081827," Electromeric effect  This effect is shown by those compounds containing multiple bonds. When a double bond or triple bond is exposed to an attack by a reagent, a pair of bonding electrons involved in the pi bond is transferred completely fron one atom to another. This effect will remain till the attacking reagent is present. As soonas the reagent is removed, the polarized molecule will come back to the original state. Electromeric effect refers to a molecular polarizability effect occurring by an intramolecular electron displacement (sometimes called the ‘conjugative mechanism’ and, previously, the ‘tautomeric mechanism’) characterized by the substitution of one electron pair for another within the same atomic octet of electrons. However, this term is now considered and this effect is considered along with the inductive effect. +E and -E groups. Electromeric effect can be classified into +E and -E effects based on the direction of transfer of the electron pair.  When the electron pair moves towards the attacking reagent, it is termed as the +E effect. The addition of acids to alkenes is an example of the +E effect. After the transfer takes place, the reagent gets attached to the atom where the electrons have been transferred to. The -E effect can be found in reactions such as addition of cyanide ion to carbonyl compounds. In these reactions, the electron pair moves away from the attacking reagent. >C=O. As another example, consider the carbonyl group, >C=O, present in electromeric effect aldehydes and ketones. When a negatively charged reagent approaches the molecule seeking positive site, it causes instantaneous shift of the bond electron pair of the C=O bond in carbonyl group to oxygen (which is more electronegative than carbon). The carbon thus becomes deprived of its share in this transferred-pair of electrons and acquires positive charge. In the meanwhile oxygen takes complete control of the electron pair and becomes negatively charged. Therefore, in the presence of attacking reagent, one bond is lost and this negatively charged attacking reagent links to the carbon having positive charge. It is temporary in nature because the molecule acquires its original electronic condition upon removal of the attacking reagent. Conclusion. ""This phenomenon of movement of electrons from one atom to another at the demand of attacking reagent in multibonded atoms is called electromeric effect, denoted as E effect. The electromeric shift of electrons takes place only at the moment of reaction. Like the inductive effect, the electromeric effect is also classified as +E and E."" Nowadays electromeric effect is often considered along with inductive effect as electron displacement.. "
wikipedia-24081997," Weather pains  Weather pains or weather related pain classified as Other specified adverse effects not elsewhere classified, is a phenomenon that occurs when people feel pain, particularly joint pain or migraine headaches correlating with changes in barometric pressure and other weather phenomena. Overview. The majority of people who suffer from conditions such as arthritis report feeling severe or less commonly moderate pain when a weather front is approaching. Symptoms also occur when the humidity level changes and when precipitation manifests itself or changes pattern. Other conditions reported in relation to this are any bone injuries, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Victims of explosives also suffer from similar pains due to micro-fractures along their skeletal system. History. The perceived relationship between changes in weather and pain has been recorded since the classical Roman age. Hippocrates was the first to note, in about 400 B.C., that many illnesses were related to changes in season. The large body of folklore about how weather affects pain is reflected by traditional sayings and expressions, such as ""aches and pain, coming rains,"" ""feeling under the weather,"" and ""ill health due to evil winds."" Case Reports. The first publication of documented changes in pain perception associated with the weather was in the ""American Journal of Medical Sciences"" in 1887. This case report described a person with phantom limb pain who concluded that ""approaching storms, dropping barometric pressure and rain were associated with increased pain complaint."" Most investigations examining the relationship between weather and pain have studied persons diagnosed with arthritis. After reviewing many case reports, Rentshler reported in the ""Journal of the American Medical Association"" in 1929 that there was strong evidence that ""warm weather is beneficial and barometric pressure changes are detrimental to patients with arthritis."" Surveys and Experimental Studies. Guedj and Weinberger attempted to correlate pain and activity levels with changes in weather by diagnosis. They instructed 16 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 24 with osteoarthritis, 11 with inflammatory arthritis, and 11 with fibromyalgia joint pain to monitor their pain and activity every day for four weeks. They found that patients whose pain was attributable to rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or fibromyalgia were all adversely affected by changes in barometric pressure. Few well-designed experimental studies have examined the effects of weather changes on pain. Humidity has been found to have an affect on the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Hollander attempted to manipulate barometric pressure and humidity in a climate-controlled room devised in his laboratories. Arthritic patients reported more pain with the combination of increased humidity and decreased barometric pressure but no change in pain when only one weather condition was changed. Although often cited, this study has been criticized because of the small number of subjects (N = 12) and the short time that the subjects were in the chamber. Possible Mechanisms. Changes in barometric pressure and temperature may increase stiffness in the joints and trigger subtle movements that heighten a nociceptive response. Such alteration of structure may be particularly problematic in inflammatory joints whose sensitized nociceptors are affected by movement. Change in barometric pressure may also cause a transient ""disequilibrium"" in body pressure that may sensitize nerve endings and account for increased pain preceding changes in temperature or humidity.

wikipedia-24082005," Arturo Guzmán Decena  Arturo Guzmán Decena (a.k.a. Z-1) (13 January 1976 − 21 November 2002) was a Mexican Army Special Forces soldier who, in 1997, defected to the Gulf Cartel, where he founded and commanded Los Zetas, the mercenary gang at the service of the cartel's drug lord, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. Guzmán Decena was born in a poor family in Puebla and joined the military as a teenager to escape from poverty. While in the military, he was a talented and bright soldier, earning a position in the Special Forces of the Mexican military by the mid-1990s. During his military career, Guzmán Decena received counter-insurgency training, acquired skills in explosives, and learned how to track down and apprehend his enemies from an elite combat group trained by the U.S. Special Forces and the Israel Defense Forces.  He began to take bribes from the Gulf Cartel while still serving in the military, but eventually defected to work full-time for the criminal organization in 1997. For years he recruited other members of the Mexican Armed Forces to form Los Zetas, the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel, along with Cárdenas Guillén. He served as the right-hand man of Cárdenas Guillén until 21 November 2002, when he was gunned down and killed by the Mexican Army in the border city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Biography. Career and military defection. Guzmán Decena was born in a poor village in Puebla, Mexico on 13 January 1976, and finished middle school and high school before joining the Mexican military to escape poverty. His talents and aggressive behavior earned him a position with an elite Mexican military group called Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), originally trained in counter-insurgency tactics for the Zapatista uprising in 1994 and for locating and apprehending members of Mexico's drug trafficking organizations. Guzmán Decena reportedly received military training from the Israel Defense Forces. His training came into practice after more than 3,000 Zapatista rebels seized several towns across the southern state of Chiapas in 1994. The rebellion was a symbolic rising against poverty and the single-party rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and many rebels took arms; the Mexican government, however, sent in the GAFE to put down the Zapatistas. Within hours, 34 rebels were killed and three others were captured by Guzmán Decena's counter-insurgency group. Their bodies were then disposed on a riverbank – with their ears and noses sliced off. Now one of the brightest, highly-trained, and bloodiest members in the GAFE, Guzmán Decena was sent to the northern state of Tamaulipas. While operating as the security chief in the city of Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas, he was recruited by Cárdenas Guillén's cartel. Investigators say that Guzmán Decena first worked with the Gulf Cartel by taking bribes from Osiel Cárdenas Guillén and turning a blind eye on the drug shipments of the cartel. Such payments were typical among military commanders, but while soldiers had often accepted bribes from the drug lords, it was not common for them to defect from the army and join their ranks. Bribes were seen by soldiers as ""benefits"" to their job, and officiers stood firm to the idea that they were protectors of the Mexican people. Guzmán Decena, however, shattered that model and left the military in 1997 to work full-time with a drug trafficking organization. According to Ioan Grillo, it is still unclear why Guzmán Decena defected from the army to become a ""narco-mercenary."" A common explanation is that Guzmán Decena left the military in search of a higher payment, seeing that many cartel members lived ostentatiously and earned more in a year than a GAFE member earned in a lifetime. Nonetheless, he would have also lived comfortably as a successful GAFE member in the army. And by joining the Gulf cartel, he was becoming a fugitive and increasing his chances of being arrested or killed. Hence, a crucial factor in his defection may have been the seismic change of Mexico's transition to democracy and the tearing rule of the PRI. The ""new Mexico"" and the democracy that came with it was feared by many soldiers who had made abuses during the old regime. Mounting pressures arose from the families of the ""disappeared"" who made marches in Mexico City, and many military officers were found guilty in courts-martial for human right abuses and corruption. For years, some military generals took bribes from the cartels; amid the turmoil, Guzmán Decena acknowledged that he was better off outside the system and as a leader of Los Zetas. Cárdenas Guillén then asked Guzmán Decena to help him recruit and set up the most ferocious hit squad possible for his cartel. Mexican federal agents later released the conversation between the two after an informant passed on the information of the new unit: Following the orders, Guzmán Decena recruited dozens of soldiers from the Mexican military. Some media outlets report that the formation of Los Zetas was the result of a ""mass defection"" of a single army unit. But military records show that this claim is false and inaccurate. Soldiers left their ranks and joined Los Zetas over some months and were from a number of different military units, but a number of GAFE soldiers made up a large part of the deserters. The members were given a codename with the letter Z, starting with Guzmán Decena with Z-1. Within some months, Guzmán Decena commanded a mercenary army of 38 defected soldiers enticed by salaries substantially higher than those paid by the Mexican government. The GAFE soldiers that went to work with the Gulf cartel took with them a number of the Mexican Army's most sophisticated machine guns, assault rifles, pistols, bazookas, grenades, and telecommunications and surveillance equipment. The role of Los Zetas was soon expanded by ""collecting debts, securing cocaine supply and trafficking routes known as 'plazas,' and executing its foes – often with grotesque savagery."" Gómez Herrera's execution. Once Juan García Ábrego, the founder of the Gulf cartel, was behind bars in 1996, Ángel Salvador Gómez Herrera (a.k.a. ""El Chava"") sought to take over the assets of the criminal organization along with Cárdenas Guillén. At first, both of them functioned well together: they bought off police officers, bribed politicians and soldiers, and managed to take control of major drug shipments coming in from Guatemala. Although supposedly Cárdenas Guillén's equal, Gómez Herrera's manipulative personality annoyed Guillén, especially after Herrera's constant requests for money loans. Such behavior offended Cárdenas Guillén, who assembled his own faction within the Gulf Cartel. But in mid-1999, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, after his daughter's baptism ceremony, ordered Guzmán Decena to execute Gómez Herrera, the godfather of Cárdenas Guillén's baby. Gómez Herrera was cordially invited to ride in Cárdenas Guillén's Dodge Durango after the ceremony. They exchanged laughs and talked for a few minutes. Guzmán Decena, who was riding in the back seat of the truck, coldly fired a bullet into Gómez Herrera's head without hesitation, splattering his brain tissue and blood across the leather dashboard. Investigators later found Herrera's decaying dead body at the outskirts of the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. For killing Gómez Herrera, Cárdenas Guillén earned his nickname, the ""Mata Amigos"" (""Friend Killer""), and Guzmán Decena, the trust of his boss. Death. Guzmán Decena was shot dead by Mexican soldiers inside a restaurant on 22 November 2002 in Matamoros, Tamaulipas after being spotted by the Mexican military. Another account written by Jesús Blancornelas indicates that Guzmán Decena went to a restaurant, had a few strong drinks, snorted a line of cocaine, and then decided to visit his mistress Ana Bertha González Lagunes, who lived a few blocks away. In order to not be interrupted, Guzmán Decena reportedly ordered his henchmen to block the street and direct traffic. Nonetheless, one of the neighbors called an anti-organized crime agency which called on the Mexican Army. When the soldiers arrived, Guzmán Decena was unable to defend himself and was shot to death. After his death, flowers in his honor were placed on the sidewalk outside the restaurant and at his gravesite. According to the photos published by the local newspapers in Matamoros, a note accompanied the flowers and read the following: Similarly, memorials were placed in the state of Oaxaca to venerate Guzmán Decena.  In an apparent revenge for Guzmán Decena's assassination, four members of the Office of the General Prosecutor were abducted and executed near Reynosa, Tamaulipas in early 2003, supposedly by Cárdenas Guillén's men. The second-in-command in Los Zetas, Rogelio González Pizaña (a.k.a.: ""Z2""), was captured in October 2004 and so Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano (a.k.a.: ""Z3"") ascended to the leadership of the paramilitary gang. Less than four months after Guzmán Decena's death, the Mexican military captured the Gulf cartel's kingpin, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, on 14 March 2003.  The death of Guzmán Decena marked the first significant success of the Mexican government against Los Zetas, but unconfirmed reports from within the organization claim that Guzmán Decena was killed by ""his own men"" on orders by Cárdenas Guillén, who feared Guzmán Decena's hegemony.

wikipedia-24038774," 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers  In 1964 three teams proposed related but different approaches to explain how mass could arise in local gauge theories. These three, now famous, papers were written by Robert Brout and François Englert, Peter Higgs, and Gerald Guralnik, C. Richard Hagen, and Tom Kibble, and are credited with the theory of the Higgs mechanism and the prediction of the Higgs field and Higgs boson. Together, these provide a theoretical means by which Goldstone's theorem (a problematic limitation affecting early modern particle physics theories) can be avoided. They show how gauge bosons can acquire non-zero masses as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking within gauge invariant models of the universe. As such, these form the key element of the electroweak theory that forms part of the Standard Model of particle physics, and of many models, such as the Grand Unified Theory, that go beyond it. The papers that introduce this mechanism were published in ""Physical Review Letters"" (PRL) and were each recognized as milestone papers by PRL's 50th anniversary celebration. Additionally, all of the six physicists were awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics for this work. On 4 July 2012, the two main experiments at the LHC (ATLAS and CMS) both reported independently the confirmed existence of a previously unknown particle with a mass of about (about 133 proton masses, on the order of 10−25 kg), which is ""consistent with the Higgs boson"" and widely believed to be the Higgs boson. Introduction. A gauge theory of elementary particles is a very attractive potential framework for constructing the ultimate theory. Such a theory has the very desirable property of being potentially renormalizable—shorthand for saying that all calculational infinities encountered can be consistently absorbed into a few parameters of the theory. However, as soon as one gives mass to the gauge fields, renormalizability is lost, and the theory rendered useless. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a promising mechanism, which could be used to give mass to the vector gauge particles. A significant difficulty which one encounters, however, is Goldstone's theorem, which states that in any quantum field theory which has a spontaneously broken symmetry there must occur a zero-mass particle. So the problem arises—how can one break a symmetry and at the same time not introduce unwanted zero-mass particles. The resolution of this dilemma lies in the observation that in the case of gauge theories, the Goldstone theorem can be avoided by working in the so-called radiation gauge. This is because the proof of Goldstone's theorem requires manifest Lorentz covariance, a property not possessed by the radiation gauge. History. Particle physicists study matter made from fundamental particles whose interactions are mediated by exchange particles known as force carriers. At the beginning of the 1960s a number of these particles had been discovered or proposed, along with theories suggesting how they relate to each other, some of which had already been reformulated as field theories in which the objects of study are not particles and forces, but quantum fields and their symmetries. However, attempts to unify known fundamental forces such as the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force were known to be incomplete. One known omission was that gauge invariant approaches, including non-abelian models such as Yang–Mills theory (1954), which held great promise for unified theories, also seemed to predict known massive particles as massless. Goldstone's theorem, relating to continuous symmetries within some theories, also appeared to rule out many obvious solutions, since it appeared to show that zero-mass particles would have to also exist that were ""simply not seen"". According to Guralnik, physicists had ""no understanding"" how these problems could be overcome. Particle physicist and mathematician Peter Woit summarised the state of research at the time: The Higgs mechanism is a process by which vector bosons can get rest mass ""without"" explicitly breaking gauge invariance, as a byproduct of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The mathematical theory behind spontaneous symmetry breaking was initially conceived and published within particle physics by Yoichiro Nambu in 1960, the concept that such a mechanism could offer a possible solution for the ""mass problem"" was originally suggested in 1962 by Philip Anderson, and Abraham Klein and Benjamin Lee showed in March 1964 that Goldstone's theorem could be avoided this way in at least some non-relativistic cases and speculated it might be possible in truly relativistic cases. These approaches were quickly developed into a full relativistic model, independently and almost simultaneously, by three groups of physicists: by François Englert and Robert Brout in August 1964; by Peter Higgs in October 1964; and by Gerald Guralnik, Carl Hagen, and Tom Kibble (GHK) in November 1964. Higgs also wrote a short but important response published in September 1964 to an objection by Gilbert, which showed that if calculating within the radiation gauge, Goldstone's theorem and Gilbert's objection would become inapplicable. (Higgs later described Gilbert's objection as prompting his own paper.) Properties of the model were further considered by Guralnik in 1965, by Higgs in 1966, by Kibble in 1967, and further by GHK in 1967. The original three 1964 papers showed that when a gauge theory is combined with an additional field that spontaneously breaks the symmetry, the gauge bosons can consistently acquire a finite mass. In 1967, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how a Higgs mechanism could be used to break the electroweak symmetry of Sheldon Glashow's unified model for the weak and electromagnetic interactions (itself an extension of work by Schwinger), forming what became the Standard Model of particle physics. Weinberg was the first to observe that this would also provide mass terms for the fermions.  However, the seminal papers on spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetries were at first largely ignored, because it was widely believed that the (non-Abelian gauge) theories in question were a dead-end, and in particular that they could not be renormalised. In 1971–72, Martinus Veltman and Gerard 't Hooft proved renormalisation of Yang–Mills was possible in two papers covering massless, and then massive, fields. Their contribution, and others' work on the renormalization group, was eventually ""enormously profound and influential"", but even with all key elements of the eventual theory published there was still almost no wider interest. For example, Coleman found in a study that ""essentially no-one paid any attention"" to Weinberg's paper prior to 1971 – now the most cited in particle physics – and even in 1970 according to Politzer, Glashow's teaching of the weak interaction contained no mention of Weinberg's, Salem's, or Glashow's own work. In practice, Politzer states, almost everyone learned of the theory due to physicist Benjamin Lee, who combined the work of Veltman and 't Hooft with insights by others, and popularised the completed theory. In this way, from 1971, interest and acceptance ""exploded""  and the ideas were quickly absorbed in the mainstream. The significance of requiring manifest covariance. Most students who have taken a course in electromagnetism have encountered the Coulomb potential. It basically states that two charged particles attract or repel each other by a force which varies according to the inverse square of their separation. This is fairly unambiguous for particles at rest, but if one or the other is following an arbitrary trajectory the question arises whether one should compute the force using the instantaneous positions of the particles or the so-called retarded positions. The latter recognizes that information cannot propagate instantaneously, rather it propagates at the speed of light. However, the radiation gauge says that one uses the instantaneous positions of the particles, but doesn't violate causality because there are compensating terms in the force equation. In contrast, the Lorenz gauge imposes manifest covariance (and thus causality) at all stages of a calculation. Predictions of observable quantities are identical in the two gauges, but the radiation gauge formulation of quantum field theory avoids Goldstone's theorem. Summary and impact of the PRL papers. The three papers written in 1964 were each recognised as milestone papers during ""Physical Review Letters"" 50th anniversary celebration. Their six authors were also awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics for this work. (A controversy also arose the same year, because in the event of a Nobel Prize only up to three scientists could be recognised, with six being credited for the papers. ) Two of the three PRL papers (by Higgs and by GHK) contained equations for the hypothetical field that eventually would become known as the Higgs field and its hypothetical quantum, the Higgs boson. Higgs's subsequent 1966 paper showed the decay mechanism of the boson; only a massive boson can decay and the decays can prove the mechanism. Each of these papers is unique and demonstrates different approaches to showing how mass arise in gauge particles. Over the years, the differences between these papers are no longer widely understood, due to the passage of time and acceptance of end-results by the particle physics community. A study of citation indices is interesting—more than 40 years after the 1964 publication in ""Physical Review Letters"" there is little noticeable pattern of preference among them, with the vast majority of researchers in the field mentioning all three milestone papers. In the paper by Higgs the boson is massive, and in a closing sentence Higgs writes that ""an essential feature"" of the theory ""is the prediction of incomplete multiplets of scalar and vector bosons"". (Frank Close comments that 1960s gauge theorists were focused on the problem of massless ""vector"" bosons, and the implied existence of a massive ""scalar"" boson was not seen as important; only Higgs directly addressed it.) In the paper by GHK the boson is massless and decoupled from the massive states. In reviews dated 2009 and 2011, Guralnik states that in the GHK model the boson is massless only in a lowest-order approximation, but it is not subject to any constraint and acquires mass at higher orders, and adds that the GHK paper was the only one to show that there are no massless Goldstone bosons in the model and to give a complete analysis of the general Higgs mechanism. All three reached similar conclusions, despite their very different approaches: Higgs' paper essentially used classical techniques, Englert and Brout's involved calculating vacuum polarization in perturbation theory around an assumed symmetry-breaking vacuum state, and GHK used operator formalism and conservation laws to explore in depth the ways in which Goldstone's theorem may be worked around. In addition to explaining how mass is acquired by vector bosons, the Higgs mechanism also predicts the ratio between the W boson and Z boson masses as well as their couplings with each other and with the Standard Model quarks and leptons. Subsequently, many of these predictions have been verified by precise measurements performed at the LEP and the SLC colliders, thus overwhelmingly confirming that some kind of Higgs mechanism does take place in nature, but the exact manner by which it happens has not yet been discovered. The results of searching for the Higgs boson are expected to provide evidence about how this is realized in nature. Consequences of the papers. The resulting electroweak theory and Standard Model have correctly predicted (among other discoveries) weak neutral currents, three bosons, the top and charm quarks, and with great precision, the mass and other properties of some of these. Many of those involved eventually won Nobel Prizes or other renowned awards. A 1974 paper in ""Reviews of Modern Physics"" commented that ""while no one doubted the correctness of these arguments, no one quite believed that nature was diabolically clever enough to take advantage of them"". By 1986 and again in the 1990s it became possible to write that understanding and proving the Higgs sector of the Standard Model was ""the central problem today in particle physics.""  "

Solutions most commonly include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chloride. Balanced salt solutions are used for washing tissues and cells and are usually combined with other agents to treat the tissues and cells. They provide the cells with water and inorganic ions, while maintaining a physiological pH and osmotic pressure. Sometimes glucose is added as an energy source and phenol red is used as a pH indicator.  In medicine, balanced salt solutions can be used as an irrigation solution such as during intraocular surgery and to replace intraocular fluids. "

wikipedia-24039271," Sport in Cuba  Sports are Cuba's national passion. Due to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate in sports which are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally promoted in other Latin American nations. Baseball is by far the most popular; other sports and pastimes include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, and athletics. Cuba is a dominant force in amateur boxing, consistently achieving high medal tallies in major international competitions. Baseball and boxing are the most popular sports in Cuba, the former being the national sport. Association football is commonly played as well. The Cuban Sports Program. Post Revolutionary Cuba prides itself on its success in sports. What the Revolution has done for sports in Cuba can be summed up by the phrase “Sport for All.” Fidel Castro believes that sports should be “the right of the people,” not the right of the wealthy. He compared Pre-Revolutionary and Post-Revolutionary Cuba by explaining that while before only the wealthy could enjoy sports, now everyone can enjoy sports. He also explains that talent in sport comes from hard work, and a strong will. These are not traits the naturally wealthy have; rather these are traits that working-class people have. In modern Cuban society, sport and physical education begin when a child is only 45 days old. The mothers are taught to exercise their children's limbs and massage their muscles to keep them healthy. Children are taught at a later age to play games that resemble physical exercise. These ideas were the basis for the modern sports program in Cuba, and clearly it is working. Considering that Cuba’s population is only around 11 million (around half the size of New York metro area), Cuba has a demanding 7.5 to 0.70 lead against the US in the number of sports medals won per million occupants. In 1961, just two years after the triumph of the Revolution, The National Institute of Sport, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER) was created. This was the governing branch of all sport and recreation in Cuba. It developed all of the current sports and education programs iun place today, including the EIDE, which is the program that finds the naturally talented young adults and gets them into sports oriented secondary schools. All first and secondary schools in Cuba teach sport and physical education as a compulsory subject. There are five sports taught in all standard secondary schools: track and field, basketball, baseball, gymnastics, and volleyball. The students who excel at a certain sport usually find themselves competing in the Cuban summer Junior Olympics which is where the EIDE sees their talent and recruits them to a specialized school that caters to just their sport. Most of these specialized schools are located on the Isle of Youth. This is a 2,200 square kilometer island to the south of Cuba which has more than 27 of these schools, each having about 600 children who attend. The majority of them are semi-boarding schools where the students get on a boat to the island every Sunday evening and return every Friday evening. The schools are spread out across the island and have citrus groves in between them. Being consistent with the ideals of the Revolution, all of the students are required to put in 3 hours of work a day picking or canning fruit. Every school in Cuba participates in the Junior Olympic Program established in 1963. However many of the standard secondary schools only compete in the sports for which they have teams, for instance most of them do not have pools. The competition usually commences in July. The games have a traditional ladder system where first local schools compete, then the district winners will compete and finally the regional winners will compete. However for team sports, the winning teams will move on, but the best players from all of the losing teams will form a new team and also move on. This way no single great player will be tossed out because of a bad team. As of 1978 the Cuban Junior Olympics involved 20 sports: Chess, Weightlifting, Athletics, Tennis, Football, Table Tennis, Basketball, Modern Gymnastics, Gymnastics, Synchronized Swimming, Swimming, Diving, Volleyball, Water Polo, Cycling, Fencing, Judo, Roller derby, Roller hockey, Pistol Shooting, Baseball and Wrestling. INDER has many programs, including the National Institute for Sports Medicine, the National Coaches program, and the National Physical Education Institute. All of these were developed during the relatively strong economic period of 1960-1990. The Special Period of the 1990s-2000s created many special challenges for INDER, including budget cutbacks and a limited amount of electricity causing blackouts. In the early 1990s, many of the night sporting events were canceled to preserve electricity. Cuba’s new sports program also began to pay for itself when many of the best players were allowed to retire early and take up position on teams in other countries. These other countries wanted to hire them because of Cuba’s fantastic success in training winning athletes. These players would earn a large salary, and about 80% of it would go directly to the Cuban government. The players would then pocket the other 20%, which was more than what the average Cuban in Cuba was earning. It is worthy to note that Castro abolished professional sport in Cuba in the beginning of the Revolution. What this meant was that all leagues and teams are considered amateur. This concept was imbedded in the stated ideals of the revolution, that everyone should be equal. However this outflow of the best athletes and trainers began to take its toll. In 1997 Cuba ended its 10-year, 152-game, winning-streak at the baseball International Cup by losing to Japan 11 to 2. To fix this problem, Cuba began to offer material incentives like houses and cars to the good players to keep them from playing for other countries. These offerings weren’t to completely prevent talented Cuban’s from leaving the country instead they were there to keep the system balanced. By the year 2007 there were 50 nations around the world who employed several hundred Cuban sports trainers and coaches. Baseball. Baseball is the official sport of Cuba. Boxing. Aside from the traditional cockfighting and other gambling sports, along with baseball, boxing was one of the most popular sports in pre-Revolutionary sports Cuba. It is still very popular on the island today. By 1992, there were over 16,000 boxers on the island. Across Cuba today there are 494 boxing coaches and 185 facilities. Of the 99,000 athletes in Cuba currently, 19,000 are boxers, including 81 of Olympic competence, even though only 12 make the Olympic team. "

wikipedia-24040808," Fable III  Fable III is the third video game in the ""Fable"" series of action role-playing open world video games. The game was published by Microsoft Game Studios and developed by Lionhead Studios for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. The story focuses on the player character's struggle to overthrow the King of Albion by forming alliances and building support for a revolution. After a successful revolt, the player becomes the monarch and is tasked with attempting to defend Albion from a great evil. The game was released on 29 October 2010 for Xbox 360 and on 20 May 2011 for PC via both Games for Windows and Steam. The PC version includes a Hardcore mode and 3D functionality not found in the Xbox 360 version. The game includes the voice acting from Ben Kingsley, Stephen Fry, Simon Pegg, Michael Fassbender, Zoë Wanamaker, Bernard Hill, Nicholas Hoult and John Cleese. Synopsis. Plot. ""Fable III"" is set 50 years after the events of ""Fable II"". The game is set on the fictional continent of Albion, which is entering the age of industry. The Hero of Bowerstone (the player character of ""Fable II"") and ruler of Albion, has died and left the Kingdom to their eldest son, Logan, the player's older brother. Some NPCs allude to how Logan has ""changed"" in the last four years of his rule, becoming excessively tyrannical. The player begins the game investigating rumours that Logan had a citizen of Albion executed, causing a group of citizens to protest. After the player character intervenes, Logan presents the player with the first of the game's numerous moral choices. The player is tasked with deciding whether the group of protesters are executed, or whether the player's love-interest is executed instead. Following the decision, the player escapes Logan's castle along with their mentor, Sir Walter Beck, and their butler, Jasper. The player then, at the behest of Theresa, the enigmatic Seeress of the Spire, starts to gather allies to aid in a revolution against Logan. The allies they gain include Sabine, the leader of the ""Dwellers"", a nomadic community that lives in the mountains; Major Swift and Ben Finn, soldiers from the Royal Army in command of a remote fort; Page, the leader of the ""Bowerstone Resistance""; and Kalin, the leader of Aurora, a desert land across the ocean. When attempting to gain the support of Kalin, the hero learns that a creature called the Crawler and the forces of the Darkness, which have already devastated Aurora, intend to exterminate all life in the Kingdom of Albion. It is revealed that Logan's reason for treating his people so harshly is to raise funds for Albion's military to defend against the Crawler. The player then leads a coup d'état and becomes the next Monarch, at which point the player is given the choice to keep the promises made to those who aided in the revolution at great expense to the treasury, or betray those promises in order to raise money for the defense of Albion through industrialization and using natural resources. The choices made help decide the hero's fate as a good or evil ruler. The player can also utilize the treasury money for personal purposes, or transfer personal money from the player's own supply to the treasury. If the player chooses to be a ""great"" ruler, the treasury will be vastly drained and the only way the player can offset this is by transferring several million gold from their personal funds to the treasury. With 6,500,000 gold in the treasury at the time of the Crawler attack, the player will be able to fully fund the defence of the entire kingdom. With no money in the treasury and thus no army to defend Albion, the civilian casualties inflicted by the Crawler's attack amount to 6,500,000. If this happens, the world will be largely absent of civilians upon completion of the main quest. If the player passes lots of time by sleeping, working and increasing the royal treasure income significantly, people will start to return. If the player was a benevolent leader but lost large sums of civilians, many citizens who return will still praise the player. However if the player raises money to fund the army through exploitation or tom-foolery, then they will be hated regardless of whether the kingdom was saved. The player can also take on the extreme evil morph. Also, it is possible to both raise funds for an army and be a benevolent ruler(in this case the player must donate his/her personal gold to the treasury until the debt is paid and the amount of 6,500,000 gold is put together), this results in the player monarch being loved by the entire kingdom and no civilian casualties. Development. At the beginning of the Gamescon announcement of ""Fable III"", Molyneux stated that the game was taking a different theme compared to the others as he believes the third game in a series to be hard to do correctly. ""If all the rules have been established and all you offer is a new story and a handful of locations, people will start to lose interest."" In an interview with OXM UK, he (Molyneux) spoke about how ""Fable"" was at risk of becoming a generic game where the player started off underpowered and weak but slowly got more powerful after they met the bad guy. After the player killed the bad guy, the credits would roll. Believing that is the formula that applies to many games, he asked why games ""end at potentially the most exciting bit?"" It was this that formed the basis of ""Fable III"", where the player can overthrow the tyrant before becoming ruler themselves. He stated that it was when the player was ruler that the consequences of ""who you are going to be, are you going to be good or evil, cruel or kind"" stopped applying only to the player, but affected the entire country. Molyneux hinted that there may be drawbacks to leaving your castle too often to investigate crimes or fight wars, asking: Talking about the inspiration for ""Fable III"", Molyneux said ""if in ""Fable I"" the inspiration was folklore and in ""Fable II"" the inspiration was King Arthur and Robin Hood, then ""Fable III"" is definitely the rebels and monarchs – both modern-day and historic."" There are also new takes on traditional ""Fable"" concepts such as morphing, where the player's weapon change depending on what they do, and their alignment. If the Hero kills large numbers of skeletons his/her weapon will appear to be made of bones, whereas if they go around killing innocent people their weapon will begin to drip with blood. The weapon will also level throughout the game, making it sharper and more deadly. Another example is the ""Extreme Emote"" system. For example, if someone angers the Hero, they can show them their true nature, with either demonic or angelic wings sprouting out of their back. Lionhead associate sound producer Georg Backer announced at the Develop conference in Brighton that ""Fable III"" would contain over 47 hours of recorded speech. This rises from 36 hours of recorded speech in ""Fable II"". Backer said that the AI is the ""biggest chunk of dialogue."" Backer also said that the over 47 hours include ""gossip lines"" in which the ""AI talk to you about what is happening in the game."" The ""30 or 40"" different types of AI characters each have ""about 2,000 lines."" Three writers wrote the 460,000 recorded words in the game and it took more than 80 actors to voice them. Many lines are ones that previously appeared in ""Fable II"", so how many hours of vocal track are original recordings is unknown. Downloadable content. Various downloadable content has been announced by Microsoft for release on 23 November ranging from dyes and extra hairstyles to new quests, much of which is actually just locked content that is already included on the game disk but requires players to pay for it separately to unlock it. The PC version will have all the Limited Collector's Edition content and 9/14 DLC content released on the Xbox 360 version included for free. The last five items are not included and must be purchased. ""Fable: Coin Golf"". An exclusive mini-game called ""Fable: Coin Golf"" developed by Ideaworks Game Studios, in close conjunction with Lionhead, was released for Windows Phone 7 on 30 March 2011. Played from an overhead perspective, your quest is to rid the land of evil and conquer each area by getting your Hero Puck into the Pillar of Light in as few shots as possible. Gold earned on the phone can be transferred to ""Fable III"" on Xbox 360 or PC and completion of each of the 3 chapters unlocks a unique weapon in Fable III. Marketing. Shortly before Gamescom 2009, images of famous revolutionaries and quotations appeared on Lionhead's website, causing discussion about what the next game Lionhead was developing. During the press conference of Gamescom, where ""Fable III"" was announced by Peter Molyneux, Lionhead had decorated the walls with medieval shields and banners. Lionhead announced in August 2010 that there would be a companion game to ""Fable III"". Peter Molyneux was quick to say that it would not be like Pub Games for Fable 2 and hinted that it would utilise a mobile-phone. The official reveal was made on September 28, 2010 for a smart-phone application titled ""Kingmaker"" The game consists of players marking real-world locations for the two factions in the game, the Royals or the Rebels. The game earns players power-ups and gold to use in ""Fable III"". The game was announced for use in the United Kingdom and Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden. Retail editions. The Xbox 360 standard and limited edition was released on the 29 October 2010, with the PC version was released in May 2011. Xbox games that were preordered (both standard and limited editions) in participating stores, were given a code for a special weapon, a code for tattoos, and a code to transfer the villager created from the Villager Maker to the game on the release date. Controller. Lionhead also released a ""Fable III"" limited edition wireless controller for Xbox 360 on 5 October 2010. The controller came with a code to unlock a unique tattoo for the game. Books. Two books titled """" and ""Fable: Blood Ties"" were released in North America and Europe in October 2010 and October 2011 respectively. The books came with DLC codes. ""The Balverine Order"" had a code for a unique weapon called the Shardborne sword while ""Blood Ties"" had a code for an exclusive Dye Pack. Both of these items were for ""Fable III"". Reception. ""Fable III"" received generally positive reception on the Xbox 360. IGN gave the Xbox 360 version an 8.5/10, praising the final segment of the game involving your role as king or queen, but criticizing its slow beginning and a lack of innovation. GameSpot gave the game a 7.5/10, saying ""This gorgeous world is brimming with humor and personality"" but felt ""a bevy of technical problems and overly simplified gameplay distract from the fun."" Official Xbox Magazine said ""Fable III is most memorable not because it makes you laugh, but because it also makes you care. If a spouse gets carved up in your absence, you'll feel pangs of guilt. When your dog saves your bacon during a fight, you'll feel pride."" The PC version of Fable III received more mixed reviews. IGN gave Fable III (PC) a 6/10, calling it ""a royal disappointment"" with ""interface not well tailored to the PC platform"", ""uneven story and pacing"", ""dull combat"" and ""repetitive quests"". GameSpot gave it a score of 7/10, saying ""It lands on the PC with graphical enhancements and tougher combat"" but criticized the ""simplified gameplay"" which ""still distract from the fun."" "
