# Automated SEO Analytics 
## ECP Ranking System
*// proposal //*

###Grading Systems
Account managers are responsible for 3 steps:


Site ranking  =>  Site traffic  =>  Conversions

This system is designed to find the overall lowest performing clients, ensuring all clients are performing to their client package potential.

## Metrics Explained
### Week to Week:
Take a look at the individual clients past weeks data, compared to the week before and see if the numbers went up or down. `Hi Mendy… I think that it might be best if you took one client and simulated what the tool would do … or, two clients, and pretending that your job was to do the 'bottom one'.  Okay?  That will help make this clearer.  Doable? That will make this much easier for me to digest.  This looks very comprehensive though!!!`
### Year to Year:
Take a look at the individual clients data from the same week last year, compared to the same week this year and see if the numbers went up or down. 

(I know there are multiple ways to divide this, either by literal date by date, week of the month or sun to sat. I’m not sure which would be best… to be discussed)
### Season:
Look at the average seasonal drop or raise across all ECP accounts from the same time period last year. Use this as a baseline to determine where the client is holding on average for the current season. 

(I know there are multiple ways to divide this, either by literal date by date, week of the month or sun to sat. I’m not sure which would be best… to be discussed)

Made up example: Last Jan we saw on average a 10% raise in X, this year we see a 5% raise... last Dec we saw on average a 10% drop in X, this year we see a 20% drop… etc

Use this average metric to determine if this client is performing below average for the current season. 
### Population Expectations:
Use a census database to determine the population of each practice location.

Putting all our ECP clients (ODLite and up) into 3-5 population categories, look at the average appointments for each location categorie to determine if the client is performing at their potential. 
### Client Type:
Use ECPs database to determine the average based on the clients package level.

### Other things to consider:
#### Number of doctors - a small practice expects / needs / can handle fewer appointments than a big practice


#### Specialty - they care less about how many, and more about quality.
Consider getting more granular in this (and monthly?) reports with the dedicated call tracking and dedicated appt forms


#### Client preferences / goals 
some clients just don’t care
or they don’t have call tracking
or something else that falsely lowers their ROI
→ We don’t want those clients to suck all our time, even though the numbers are bad. some clients are very demanding, even if performing well objectively
Or they’re interested in 1 metric not shown here, like “improve rankings for vision therapy in North York keywords”
→ They may need more attention to keep them happy and prevent a quit
=> We need an override option

Prioritize time by client bill?
New vs 
Metro vs 
ODSpec vs 
MultiLoc vs
ODLingo vs 
ODLite

### Client Types
- ODSite - 
- ODLite - 
- ODLingo - 
- ODMultiLoc - Each location should be graded individually by appointments and SERPs
- ODSpecialty -
- ODMetro - 
- ODExamBank -
- ODCorporate?
- ODPPC?

### Prerequisites 
In order for this to be effective there would need to be consistency across all accounts. 

This would mean that each client type would have to be very specifically defined and up to date in Ninja. For example, ODLite has X KWs in their report, ODLingo has X KWs etc. 

### Poor Performers:
**Step 1:** 

Find the bottom 10 for each metric: appointments, SERPs, bounce rate, site traffic and CTR.

**Step 2:** 

Each of the bottom 10 should be given a variable, the lowest 10 the second lowest 9 etc.

**Step 3:** 

If a client has more than 1 variable allocated to it they should all be added together

**Step 4:** 

The account with the highest integer should be ranked as the client that needs the most attention. 

**Step 5:** 

At the beginning of each week, send the bottom 10 of each AMs client load, to the AM for working on.

**Step 6:** 

With each client the ere should be an attached auto troubleshooting suggestion note.  


**Dashboard**
There are many ideas, please let me know if you want me to write one out in detail. 

Auto Troubleshooting System

When its determined that a client is not performing as well as it could/should be...

**Suggestions:**

*CRO (Appointments)* = CTAs, images, design, easy navigation, bounce rate, copy, colour and font palette, UX, reviews

**Suggestions:**

*SERP Ranking* = GMB, high traffic, pagespeed, H tags, text KW optimisation, content, alt tags, silo, meta tag, structure, sitemap, indexed, mobile accessibility, site age, bounce rate, URL, backlinks, citations, LRS

**Suggestions:**

*CTR (Google)* = SERP ranking, metadata, URL, reviews

**Suggestions:**

*Site Traffic* = SERP ranking, citations, backlinks, PR, PPC, metadata

**Suggestions:**

*Bounce rate* = Site structure, content, images, design, color contrast, 404s, pagespeed, mobile accessibility, H tags, page links, page relevance
