# Task: 12

---

.... here goes :)  ...

Task 12 is; review SQL tasks **7 thru 11** very well, to the point that you're able to redo **all** 5 SQL queries **from scratch** in less than a half hour!

Next time we meet, we'll put a timer on and you'll do all 5 SQL queries and finish in less than 30 minutes.

This is absolutely crucial in order build up your **SQL-muscle-memory**  ;)

Good luck!
