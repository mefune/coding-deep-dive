# Task: 7

[Link to Task:](https://github.com/Ylazerson/coding-deep-dive/blob/master/sql/sql-hw-tasks/sql-assignments/sql-task-007.md)

- Try to do one (and only one) "step" column in each with statement
- That you can slowly build up the solution
- Each "step" column is based on prior "step" column(s)
- If you get blocked and can't solve a certain "step" column, take a peek at sql-task-007.sql
- This is a real business-need SQL puzzle, so don't be surprised if it takes you a few days or more

### Tips:

The following SQL "tools" might help:

- `with` statement
- `case` statement
- `substr` function
- `lower` function
- `strpos` function
- `safe_cast` function
- `cast` function
- `replace` function
- `trim` function
- `concat` function
